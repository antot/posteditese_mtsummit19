Qingdao is the 12th country in Shandong Province is also the first to discharge the right to use and trade pilot city .
11th , a number of enterprises respectively came to Qingdao emissions Trading Center to submit the right to apply for discharge , the purchase will be paid after the payment of fees .
This will be completed the first single transaction is also indicative of Qingdao emissions trading pilot work officially kicked off , which would also be the first single emissions trading in the province and the national city-level emissions trading first .
11th morning , Qingdao Double Peach Fine Chemicals ( Group ) Co . , Ltd . General manager Zhooping came to the Qingdao Emission Trading Center to submit the right to discharge the purchase .
The company is located in the old town of Qingdao factory last year , the end of a comprehensive shutdown , environmental relocation to the Pingdu of the plant .
Zhooping submitted the application form , the construction project environmental impact report , and other materials , Qingdao emission rights reserve and trading service Center began to the application materials first-instance .
According to the Qingdao city price , finance and other departments to determine the collection criteria , the current estimated initial sewage right to use about 641,200 yuan , staff will be within 7 working days to complete the approved .
This will be completed the first single transaction is also indicative of Qingdao emissions trading pilot work officially kicked off , will also be the province &apos;s emissions trading first single and national city-level emissions trading first .
Zhooping said that the current enterprise environmental protection has been invested up to 400 million , the surface amount is huge , but the enterprise management philosophy , social benefits have a great impact on enterprise innovation management also opened up space .
The same day , Qingdao Sifang Xin Zhi Zhuo passenger car parts Co . , Ltd. also to the annual output of 4,200 pieces of high-speed rail and EMU interior accessories project requisition pollution rights .
The project is a mechanical processing enterprise , the initial discharge right of the application for chemical oxygen demand ( COD ) of 0.514 tons / year , ammonia nitrogen ( NOX ) 0.052 tons / year .
The pollutant emission right of air pollutants is paid use and transaction is the key industrial enterprise of power supply and thermal production .
Prior to January 1 , 2016 , the existing sewage disposal unit of EIA has not been levied for a fee .
&quot; The right to obtain pollution from the sewage is not equal to the right to the illegal discharge of pollutants . &quot;
Qingdao Environmental Protection Bureau deputy director of the Han Red Yan introduced , if the illegal discharge , exceeding the sewage still should be punished according to the relevant regulations , it is impossible to allow illegal enterprises through the purchase of pollution right way to avoid punishment .
In other words , by means of legal measures to crack down on environmental violations , severely punish the excessive discharge of enterprises , thereby protecting the environment and safeguarding public health .
Now enterprises in order to their own interests , improve the enthusiasm of pollution control , cherish the limited emission rights , reduce pollutant emissions .
With the drive of economic benefits , reducing pollutant emissions from the government &apos;s compulsory behavior into the enterprise conscious market behavior , so as to really achieve the protection of the environment , protection of nature , the purpose of safeguarding public health .
The right to discharge is also called &quot; emission right , &quot; which is the right to emit pollutants , which is the right to emit pollutants to the environment within the limits allocated by the Government .
In essence , this right is the right of polluters to occupy , use and benefit the environmental capacity resources .
Next , under the premise that the total pollutant emissions do not exceed allowable emissions , the internal pollution sources are exchanged with each other by means of currency exchange .
Emissions trading since 1968 by American economist Dales , the United States in the 1970s began to apply it to the management of atmospheric and river pollution sources .
China since 2007 to carry out pilot , now has Zhejiang , Jiangsu and other 14 provinces ( regions , municipalities ) in full implementation .

China &apos;s Mars program is coming
The mission of Mars exploration in China is to be rounded , landed and inspected at once , and this form has never been in foreign countries .
The goal of our Mars reconnaissance launch is to get around , to land , to patrol , this task is very difficult .
Because the Mars probe will take 26 months to meet a time window , experts are working on a rigorous engineering plan to launch the country &apos;s first Mars probe in the 2020 window .
According to Hudazhe , although China &apos;s aircraft has entered deep space , but the completion of the mission is still indispensable , detection of Mars means that China from the real sense into the deep space exploration era .
&quot; Once every two or three years , there is a chance that Mars will be able to launch a Mars probe at this point in time , which is the most energy-saving for a launch vehicle . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Given the quality of the Mars probe , the launch mission will be carried out by China &apos;s Long March No . Fifth launch vehicle . &quot; &quot;
The mission of Mars exploration in China is to be rounded , landed and inspected at once , and this form has never been done abroad , and it has been proposed to be rounded and landed , but the landing failed .
There are many technical areas involved in Mars exploration , and , in particular , although the rover is a space detector , it has distinct characteristics compared with the general space probe .
That is to say , the Mars rover has the ability to determine the route and the danger of discovering obstacles .
Part , a researcher at the five Academy of China Aerospace Technology Group , said that the reason why humans are so popular with Mars exploration is that it has important scientific , technological and other implications , even for the future of mankind .
Mars has now become the planet with the highest level of human research beyond Earth , and the History of Mars exploration by using space probes has been almost throughout the history of human spaceflight .
As a result , humans hope to build a living base on Mars and eventually immigrate to Mars , turning it into a second home for mankind .
There are plenty of signs that Mars , like the current Earth , has only evolved over billions of of years to become thinner , cooler , and drained of water .
As a result , exploration or manned landings on Mars can be used to prevent the Earth from becoming a second Mars for human survival .
As of June 2016 , the world conducted 114 lunar probes and 43 Martian probes .
However , since the 1990s , humans have conducted 18 Martian probes , while lunar probes have been conducted only 14 times .
There are currently 5 Mars Orbiter and 2 Mars rover working , but only a 1-month ball orbiter and a lunar lander are working .
The world &apos;s space Powers have developed a plan to target the Mars system , which shows that today &apos;s Mars is hotter than lunar exploration .
On November 5 , 2013 , India launched its first Mars probe , &quot; Mangarian , &quot; to become Asia &apos;s first successful country to detect Mars .
&quot; Mangarian &quot; is used to study the surface , atmosphere and mineral characteristics of Mars to see if there are any signs of methane and life on Mars .
The hardest part of this mission is that the probe enters the Martian atmosphere , with the aerodynamic shape and parachute deceleration only one chance .
The Mars reconnaissance mission faces many technical challenges , according to General architect Sun , director of the Mars probe , five yuan of China Aerospace Technology Group .
The atmospheric pressure on Mars is very low , with a high degree of uncertainty , only 1 % of the Earth &apos;s surface atmosphere .
Scientists have not yet got a thorough understanding of the changes and characteristics of storms .
Mars often forms dust storms similar to Earth &apos;s dust in summer , which can cause a sharp drop in the amount of solar energy The rover receives , and must design a &quot; dormant &quot; model for the rover to wait patiently for the dust storm to pass .
At the same time , the Martian atmosphere has a reduced effect on solar illumination , which poses a problem for the energy supply that Mars detects .
This requires that the detector &apos;s solar wing area is larger , and it needs to be constantly adjusted to aim for the sun .
Also , Mars &apos; surface gravity is only 38 % that of the earth , but much more than the gravity of the moon &apos;s surface , so the detectors need greater power .
&quot; The core and hardest part of this mission is the process of the spacecraft &apos;s aerodynamic appearance and parachute deceleration after entering the Martian atmosphere , with only one chance to ensure success , &quot; he said . &quot;
Sun said that because the Earth and Mars far away , the whole process can not be real-time control of the ground , so must rely on the detector to do it autonomously .
Because there are not so many propellants to offset that high speed , the slowdown depends on the Martian atmosphere when landing on Mars , but the Martian atmosphere is hard to simulate on the ground .
In general , part said , the way to detect Mars is similar to the way the moon is detected , and it is also a &quot; detour , Fall , patrol , return &quot; to achieve the goal of manned landing on Mars .
Since Mars is much farther from Earth than the moon , exploring Mars needs to overcome a series of more complex technical hurdles .
Taiwan &apos;s chief executive , Lin Quan , announced yesterday morning that the &quot; political parties and their accompanying organization &apos;s improper acquisition of property regulations &quot; came into effect today , according to Taiwanese media reports .
KMT vice chairman Jianghi said , &quot; a more than 100-year-old Kuomintang , with social commitment and responsibility , will not fail in this way . &quot;
Lin Quan stressed that if a political party , an affiliated organization or a trustee manager , etc. violate the provisions of the prohibition imposed by the regulations , the Commission shall investigate and punish the penalty according to the terms of reference .
Lin Quan also announced that the Vice-Chairman of the party &apos;s production committee would be appointed by Hongpegen , deputy director of the ICAC .
He said that Koo as the Main Committee of the Commission is the only candidate , borrowing Hongpegen in the past to examine the relevant major cases of experience , will be the Committee to inventory the relevant cases of improper party production basis .
Jianghi believes that today , as long as there is party production , no one will give you social donations , if the party produced all confiscated away , the Kuomintang just can request social support and sponsorship , &quot; Today really do not have the opportunity to go . &quot;
Jianghi also stressed that even if improper party production regulations on the road , the Kuomintang party production has not been completely confiscated , confiscated , the rest will still be pledged to give out , so that the party to zero , the party should all start from scratch .

The contradiction between supply and demand will affect ordinary users , it is time to choose a good channel , the first time low price to start the authentic IPhone7 .
According to people familiar with the information , recently , Suning high-level and Apple company frequently meet , the purpose is to prepare sufficient supply .
Operators have talked with Su Ning , it can be foreseen that , with the depth of cooperation between the two sides will inevitably bring lower prices and more intimate services to users .
&quot; The lowest price , the consumer may &apos; just 7 yuan a day , can buy IPhone7 &apos; . &quot; &quot;
Sufficient supply and diversity of concessions , so that the purchase of IPhone7 no longer &quot; pressure , &quot; and Suning &apos;s logistics , it will make this beautiful into a more intuitive experience .

On the morning of August 12 , the State Council News office held a press conference on the operation of national economy in July 2016 .
Laiyun , Director of National Bureau of Statistics and Statistics , said that in July , some indicators of the national economy slowed down , but still operating in a reasonable range .
Statistics released by the National Bureau of Statistics show that July fixed assets investment growth , total imports and other data fell .
Laiyun said that on the national economy in the July , I would like to borrow the words of the prime Minister has said that &quot; the shape of volatility , the trend is still good , &quot; which can better summarize the characteristics of the July economic operation .
He explained that &quot; form fluctuation &quot; means that some of the growth rate of economic indicators in July did fall .
Since July domestic and foreign economy is still in the depth adjustment , the international situation is complex and changeable , the world economy recovery is not expected , so the export pressure is still relatively big .
From the domestic situation , the whole economy is still at the critical stage of adjustment , the pain of adjustment is released , the economy is facing a big downward pressure , so some of the indicators are somewhat volatile .
Laiyun pointed out that there is a special situation in July , the flood disaster is more serious , high temperature and heat weather on some areas of production and operation has brought some impact .
According to the Ministry of Civil Affairs recently released the situation , more than 60 million people nationwide disaster , direct economic losses of more than 200 billion yuan .
From the relevant indicators of industry , investment and transportation , these areas are affected in varying degrees .
In July , the volume of goods turnover slowed down by 3.6 % last month , and the flood disaster had a certain impact on the traffic in these areas .
Judging from these factors , the volatility of some of the July indicators is also normal and is expected .
He said , &quot; the potential is still good &quot; means that despite the slowdown in economic growth , but the overall smooth economic operation , stability in the direction of the good trend has not changed .
July CPI Rose 1.8 % , the chain Rose 0.2 % ; 1-July CPI Rose 2.1 % , so the price situation is generally stable .
According to the Chongqing Meteorological Bureau Portal Network on the high temperature of the statistics , in addition to Youyang , the rest of our city can receive different degrees of high temperature allowance .
At least 28 provinces in the country have clearly defined the criteria for granting allowances , although the standards are not the same , while Chongqing receives the high temperature allowance in the form of a high temperature working day allowance .
35 ℃ above 37 ℃ , per person per day not less than 10 Yuan standard issued , 37 ℃ above , per person per day not less than 15 yuan standard issued .
40 ℃ above the high temperature staff can receive a monthly allowance of up to 20 yuan / day ( except that the worker has already enjoyed the high temperature work allowance according to law ) .
According to this standard , last month high temperature weather days the most open state can receive 330 yuan , the minimum number of days of Chengkou is 80 yuan , and Youyang the highest temperature due to not meet the high temperature standard , so there is no high temperature allowance .
In the past , a number of flats will be charged with the high temperature allowance with cool drinks , the bureau said .
The employing unit shall not deduct or reduce the wages of the laborers because of the high temperature and the shortening of working time .
City People &apos;s bureau said that staff encountered high temperature work but did not receive the high temperature allowance , can be through the enterprise &apos;s labor dispute mediation institutions to seek legal rights , or call 12333 complaints .
If the employer refuses to grant the high temperature allowance , the laborer may lodge a complaint with the competent department of Human Resources Social Security at the county level .
At the same time , because the high temperature allowance is a part of wages , not benefits , to be included in payroll , deduction of tax .
Therefore , the high temperature allowance is not in the minimum wage range , must be issued in cash form , can not use beverages and other physical substitutes .

Gracian is an eruption of female giant beak bird , the whole body exudes the breath of the rainforest .
In the Central American country Costa Rica , the Gracian and its story has long been a household name .
At the August 10 press conference , the Gracian of postoperative recovery finally unveiled its brand-new 3D print-plastic beak .
The giant beak , which had been broken up by a 1.5 ago and was dying , has now finally been reborn .
Not only did this day proclaim that it was 100 % restored to health , it was the day when it moved into the luxury aviary and met with the human friends who cared for it .
First entered the new home of the Gracian slightly shy , but not too much to become lively , in the water Basin , roll frolic , with a new beak to eat grapes .
To remind people of the damage it had suffered , the technician did not paint its new beak , but retained the original white of the 3D printing material .
Outside the beak is a thin layer of cutin sheath , inside hollow , only some thin bone supporting rod staggered arrangement .
Despite this internal reinforcement , the beak of a giant beak is fragile and broken when it is hurt .
The animal Rescue Center , a bird biologist and a US 3D printing company worked together to produce several &quot; test beaks &quot; for Gracian , finally creating the &quot; perfect beak &quot; best suited to it .
Now Gracian is adept at using new beaks to drink , eat , and even peck up tiny grains .
&quot; The final finished design took about 2 months to print out and only 4 , 5 hours . &quot; &quot;
&quot; 3D printing is not the future technology , it has actually come into your life . &quot; &quot; U.S. Sg3d printing company Chairman 托马斯 · 朗格 in an interview with Xinhua International reporter said .
In January 2015 , a farm in Gracian , a Alajuela province in central Costa Rica , was found to be a blood-soaked giant beak gracian .
Its upper beak was brutally broken by a gang of young men , and it was utterly incapable of eating and dying .
Gracian &apos;s horror was reported in the media , in Costa Rica and outside the cause of the wave of opposition to cruelty to animals .
Stricter animal-protection laws and tougher punishments for abusers are called for .
People come spontaneously and do their best to help Gracian to recover as much as possible before the injury .
Even 3D print technology inventor 查克 · 赫尔 was involved in the design of Gracian &apos;s beak .
&quot; The Gracian is very special , its upper beak is less than 1 centimeters , so it poses many difficulties in installing the new beak . &quot; &quot;
&quot; We scanned the Gracian and then designed and produced an elongated prosthesis that was slightly longer than the remainder of its upper beak , which was glued to its upper beak . &quot; &quot;
&quot; This can reduce further invasive damage to Gracian . &quot; Lange told Xinhua International correspondent .
Before installing the prosthesis , the worker cleans up the beak for Gracian every day to prevent infection .
Far away , the story of giant Beak bird Gracian moved the famous documentary filmmaker Paula 拉 · 埃雷迪亚 and Discovery News channel producer 约翰 · 霍夫曼 .
They recorded the gracian of the new Beak , recording a documentary film , &quot; The Kingdom of the giant beak , &quot; which was broadcast on the Animal Planet Channel this month .
The country of the giant beak shows how a tiny giant beak can change a country and involve its citizens in the fight against cruelty to animals .

Japanese oil companies are particularly wary of the rise of China &apos;s small independent refineries , known as &quot; teapots . &quot;

&quot; After the end of 2015 , China began exporting high quality light oil to Australia , &quot; JX Energy said , creating competition with Japanese products in Asian markets .
Although &quot; Japan &apos;s high oil &quot; is facing a crisis , Japan &apos;s oil companies to respond to the strategy is &quot; focus on the market while the profit can be exported to the region . &quot;
As China &apos;s exports of oil products have a huge impact on Asian markets , they are increasingly concerned about teapot refineries .

On some nights , the ionosphere is full of free electrons , which means that radio signals can go farther .
The U.S. Air Force is interested in the effect of replication , according to the August 11 report of the Popular Science Monthly website .
While the ionosphere , which has a stable mass of free electrons , can help people listen to the radio at the edge of a university radio station , that may not be the interest of the U.S. Air Force .
The electron-filled ionosphere means that the military uses a greater range of radios , and it may provide some protection from the Global Positioning System ( GPS ) signals from solar storms .
The ultimate goal may be to build a series of cube satellites based on demand , which can strengthen the ionosphere when needed .
But first , the team that signed the contract with the Air Force must demonstrate that the scientific principles will work .
Industry data show that 2015 coal production capacity of nearly 6 billion tons , the national coal production capacity of 1.8 billion tons .
In recent ten years , the State Council has issued a total of 5 times before and after the elimination of excess and backward production capacity notice .
Although the first 4 times did not target the coal industry , but the target industry directly with the coal industry to produce relations .
Last November to this January , Qinhuangdao 5500 kcal power coal prices for a long time in 370 yuan / ton low hovering , 90 % of coal enterprises into a loss .
And since February , coal prices have gradually picked up , the recent Qinhuangdao power coal price is continuously rising around , rose to a 16-month high , once climbed to 436 yuan per ton , a rise of nearly 70 yuan than the beginning .
As the price picks up , all the worries come along : Will a batch of small coal mines return to resuming production ?
In this respect , China ( Hainan ) Reform and Development Institute of Economic Director Kao Xianming Analysis and interpretation .
Kao Xianming : To production capacity has aroused the attention of all parties , the coal industry released today to the production capacity of the report card also really make everyone feel more worried .
The three-layer factor reflects the relative lag of our growth patterns in the past , where the government-led growth pattern has not yet undergone a fundamental shift .
Second , this is directly related to the promotion of local government , in the process of going to capacity , funds and corresponding measures are to be in place , from this perspective , the difference between different regions is indeed relatively large .
Third , if some of the provinces that are slower now are going to catch up in the second half of the year , they may face greater risks .
In this case , the process of boosting the capacity by relying on the central prize for funding may have some negative effects .
First of all , go to capacity is not simple to carry out total control .
Our aim is to reconstruct the new industry of the whole coal industry by eliminating backward production capacity and promoting structural optimization .
In the process of deployment to capacity , the local government must combine the production capacity with the transformation and upgrading of the coal industry , and vigorously develop the related services .
Secondly , in order to complete this year &apos;s capacity task , we should give full play to the power of administrative supervision and administrative monitoring .
Finally , we should strengthen the reveals role of social security .
Because the market directly involves the problem of employment , we should strengthen the employment skills training for employees and workers .

Ningzetao &apos;s performance in the semi-finals of the 100-metre freestyle has made many Chinese audiences silent .
But in the 50-metre freestyle preliminaries , Ningzetao once again refreshed people &apos;s &quot; bottom line . &quot;
In fact , 50 meters freestyle is not Ningzetao items , his performance in the Kazan World Championships and the best results , but also decided that his project to make a breakthrough is unlikely .
Sure enough , Hong Kong &apos;s authoritative media , the big communiqué , revealed that the biggest reason for Ningzetao &apos;s failure was that he had lost interest in swimming .
Many factors outside the field may have had a big impact on his ideas for the future , and he is now more interested in entering the entertainment circle .
Kazan World Championships , Ningzetao by virtue of its super high value and good results , instant become a net red .
Thus , &quot; national husband , &quot; &quot; small meat , &quot; &quot; pattern of the United States &quot; and other forms of address has become his label .
A variety of business activities to find the door , the good money , become a glittering road .
In this case , Ningzetao even choose to retire at this time to join the entertainment circle , is not only his freedom , but also a plausible path .
After all , he is only 23 years old , after a certain amount of study , can rely on his popularity to play one or two TV dramas .
But Ningzetao need to see , oneself and these predecessors compared , not have enough qualifications ?
The 2000 Sydney Olympic Games , the 21-year-old Xuan has come to the end of the athlete &apos;s career .
Xuan &apos;s beautiful appearance made her quickly remembered and laid the groundwork for her future foray into the entertainment circle .
After retiring , Xuan starred in a number of TV dramas and set up his own studio in 2013 .
Tian participated in the two Olympic Games single two-person 10-meter competition , and won 2 Gold 2 silver .
But after losing to teammate Hu Jia in the 2004 Olympic Games single 10-meter competition , Tian &apos;s athletic state declined and was fired by the diving team .
And he and his daughter to participate in &quot; Dad to where &quot; and other variety shows , but also let him earn enough eyeballs .
Once the gymnastics gold generation Yang , Xiaopeng and yibing all high-profile participate in various variety shows .
It is worth mentioning that , Yang Xiaopeng then led China to win the 2008 Olympic Games Nan Champion , Yang is two times to get a personal all-around gold , known as the Almighty King .
While Yibing led China to the 2012-year Olympic Group championship , it also became the King of the Rings .
And in the London Olympic Games suffered a miscarriage of justice after the loss of gold , yibing magnanimous move , also let him circle powder countless .
But the athletes &apos; main energy is still on the field , and for the variety show is just like a superficial-touch off .
But whether it is retired or active athletes , to be able to get the favor of the entertainment circle need to get the results to do the protection .
After all , the athlete enters a new field , whether ability or network , is a blank state .
Even the &quot; old man , &quot; who has been in the entertainment circle for many years , is Tian and Xuan , and the average audience is still thinking about their performance at the Olympics .
And Yang , Xiaopeng and other new , in the variety show when the introduction , no exception is &quot; Olympic champion . &quot;
Compared to the above several people , Ningzetao a swimming world champion &apos;s first name still slightly thin .
Moreover , compared to Tian , Xuan , Yang and other people &apos;s career , Ningzetao if in 23 years of age , a little setback in sports life Jiliuyongtui , the image of its negative impact is probably immeasurable .
After all , to mention the athletes , people &apos;s requirements are &quot; not to seek the invincible , but for the sake of difficulties , &quot; Ningzetao distance this point is still a lot worse .
10,000 step back said , Ningzetao long handsome , can rely on the value of beauty to obtain thousands of brain residue powder support .
No point of skill , only rely on the appearance , want to mix in the entertainment circle , this difficulty is not better than good training back to the state is difficult .
The way of life choice depends on the individual will , but in the end how to choose , Ningzetao heart should have several .
On the face of it , the network social platform expands the communication circle and reduces people &apos;s sense of loneliness .

A survey of college students &apos; social habits shows that 57 % of college students use their mobile phones more than 5 hours a day , and the basics of daily life are &quot; not on hand . &quot;
&quot; Social networks have the characteristics of low cost , fast transmission speed and simultaneous communication among many people , which is in line with the needs of contemporary college students . &quot; &quot;
Expanding the circle of relationships , talking more equitably , and avoiding social concerns are the main reasons why we love online chat .
Just entered the company &apos;s new love with colleagues online communication , &quot; because only into the unit is not very familiar , through the social platform of Praise comments , the relationship is much closer than before . &quot;
Love friends also commonly used on-line communication , &quot; before with friends because some misunderstanding for a period of time did not contact , and later in a large group of dialogue before a few words and heat up . &quot; &quot;
It engineer Wu Yan is a deep network of social enthusiasts , most of his social life occurs online , network contacts are more than the number of online friends circle .
Wu Yan himself also frankly in the network more &quot; duck to water . &quot;
&quot; You can reply to your friends when you want to , because there are a lot of time to think about it . &quot;
&quot; Hidden under the ID of you come to me to avoid face-to-face interpersonal collisions , not only have the leeway to maneuver , even give each other more time and space to contemplate words and deeds . &quot;
&quot; People of different identities have the same rights and efficiency to speak , and social concerns in real life seem to have been eliminated in cyberspace , &quot; he said . &quot;
However , Wu Yan &apos;s friend Xiao Peng felt that the life of Wu Yan is a &quot; pretty boring otaku . &quot;
Xiao Peng and Wu Yan in a large group of acquaintances , because both are active speakers , soon cooked up .
Xiaopeng think Wu talk with the network , speech boring , also do not take the initiative to comment , tossing and turning is a few words &quot; hehe , good , is it , &quot; or &quot; This I want to check the Internet . &quot;

Observers generally believe that Japan has been generous to Africa for two purposes : to increase Japan &apos;s sense of presence in Africa and to win the support of African countries on the issue .
&quot; From a political point of view , Africa , although relatively underdeveloped , has a larger number of countries , so Japan has always regarded it as a so-called &apos; large field , &apos; &quot; said Yang Bojiang , a Japanese expert . &quot;
In the future , Japan will not give up , and its work on Africa will not be terminated .
Economic aspect , because Japan &apos;s production capacity is relatively strong , but the domestic market is comparatively limited , especially at present in the background of the minority aging , domestic demand is relatively depressed .
However , from Junichiro Koizumi , 10 ago , to Abe , 10 years later , Japan has repeatedly launched the &quot; sprint , &quot; but all failed to return .
Japan &apos;s expert Yang Bojiang believes that Japan &apos;s intention to glance at the usual , but the road to the usual will be difficult .
In order to achieve its goal , Japan must first make good relations with neighboring countries , in which the Japanese need to have a correct attitude , whether in the geopolitical contest or in the national dispute and the historical understanding .

Liu Yigui stressed that Sanya should seize the opportunity of historical development , take &quot; double repair &quot; and &quot; Twin Cities &quot; pilot work as an important hand , and give full play to the leading role of demonstration in the economic and social development of the province .
To promote international tourism island to play a good role in the internationalization , from the details , rich international elements , to create international products .
To play a leading role in urban-rural integration and tourism in the whole region , speed up the construction of characteristic and amorous town , integrate the elements of tourism into each project , and build every village and town in Sanya into a tourist area .
We should play a leading role in &quot; service Social investment Hundred Days , &quot; promote a number of major projects and park construction , ensure the landing of high-quality projects , the implementation of the requirements of the major action .
Party committee , Sanya Municipal Committee secretary Zhang , vice Governor Wang , provincial government Secretary-General Lu Zhiyuan participated in the research discussion .
Deng Yaping in the 14 sports career , a total of 18 world championships , the Chinese Olympic Games in the history of the first win four Olympic gold medals .
She kept the world first in the tennis rankings for 8 consecutive years and was the longest-running female athlete in the history of table tennis .
September 26 , 2010 , Deputy Secretary-General of People &apos;s daily and the general manager of the popular search network AG , the stall-level cadres .
Recently , she will join hands with Yu to create the first domestic sports industry innovation and entrepreneurship platform .
Chinese sports also have such a group of star coaches : they are in the athletes era of unlimited glory for the country to win countless , after the retirement will be taught for many years later , to cultivate the winner .
As the first world champion of Chinese men &apos;s gymnastics , Huang chose to pick up the pointer after retiring .
From the female team coach to the male team coach , then to head coach , Huang built an &quot; Olympic gold Regiment , &quot; the more rate team in the Beijing Olympic Games won 9 Gold 1 silver 4 bronze myth record .
Since then , Tian has been advertising endorsements , but also in recent years played a &quot; cowboy , &quot; &quot; Lei Feng &quot; and other important roles .
Many NBA players have proved their strength . But some progress is the downfall of others .
Whether it &apos;s because of the age or the time limit , there are some players who will show a setback every season .
Of course , some &quot; backwards &quot; may just be the shrinking of the data , and the players &apos; strength may not fall .
Even though Wade is still one of the league &apos;s best scoring guards , his performance at the Bulls should not be as good as the heat .
He and Rondo have a limited range of the back field , the Star Butler &apos;s three-point hit is only 32.8 % , which makes them very crowded next season &apos;s attack .
Came to the Windy City , the Lightning man will be more than the ball to Butler and long , he is likely to choose in the regular game regimen .
Okafor &apos;s situation was awkward and , as the first choice for 76 people last season , he had to compete with Simmons and Embid in the new season .
This competition may not come quickly , Simmons also needs to adapt to the NBA arena , Embid also want to recover from the injury as soon as possible , but the Okafor can be 76 people in the long array of positions is still a problem .
Last season , Okafor &apos;s 32 % score came from low attacks , which were higher than Caucins , Vucevic and 布鲁克 · 洛佩斯 , while his use was high in the top 40 of the league .
As Simmons has shown excellent control striker potential , Embid also has a better fit for the NBA game , and Okafor &apos;s position may be hard to stabilize .
For the past two seasons , Thompson &apos;s usage has stabilized in the top 20 of the league , which is the best two seasons of his career .
The problem , however , is that with Durant &apos;s arrival , Thompson &apos;s usage rate will surely drop , which will affect his play .
This effect will not only be the impact of the number of shots , Tang Shin &apos;s ball attack in the next season will certainly be greatly reduced , which in some ways will reduce the opponent &apos;s defense difficulty .
Durant &apos;s arrival will certainly make the Warriors &apos; figures shrink , but the most serious shrinkage is Thompson .
But that does not mean that Tang Shin &apos;s level of decline is more likely to make a sacrifice for the team as a whole .
Parker &apos;s performance last season was better than the data reflected , not only because his basket efficiency came to the highest level , but he and Aldridge &apos;s chemistry also benefited the Spurs .
Duncan retired , and Gino announced another year of war , the combination of GDP finally came to an end , as the youngest of three people , the French sports car is not much oil in the tank .
After winning the third championship ring , only Kareem Abdul-Jabbar , Jordan and Rasselbijams won more regular MVP , and Jordan was the only one FMVP James Dore .
Oh , yes , James has just brought Cleveland the first professional sports champion trophy in the last 52 years .
James , who has come to the 14th season of his career , needs to be better prepared for the playoffs .
So in the regular season , James &apos; data is likely to fall further and he will take more of the burden to Owen , but he will still be easily the top three player in the league .
&quot; Be sure to learn from the domestic talent in Russia to develop . &quot;
12th local time , the chairman of the Moscow Overseas Chinese Federation Huang in the see Beijing reporter excitedly said .
Not long ago , she participated in the National Chinese Affairs Office of the State Council of China , Jinan University sponsored by the &quot; Overseas Chinese Cultural Community Chinese talent ( calligraphy , painting ) training courses . &quot;

Nayanwe , the Secretary-General of the Russian Association for the promotion of Chinese culture , also has the same feeling .
She said that she has made great progress with the help of the teachers in the training course , and also felt the heavy responsibility as &quot; the overseas disseminator of Chinese culture . &quot;
Nayanwe said that after returning to Russia , he must spread and promote the Chinese traditional culture among the Chinese and the Russians who love Chinese culture .

Unfortunately , OPEC &apos;s latest monthly report shows that crude oil production continued to rise in July and Saudi Arabia &apos;s output hit a record high .
The report raises doubts about the credibility of OPEC , and the road to recovery is still fraught with thorns .
In Monday , OPEC &apos;s rotating chairman and Qatar Energy Minister Sadah said OPEC would hold an informal meeting during the International Energy Forum in September and 26-28th .
OPEC &apos;s Wednesday monthly report showed that OPEC , including Gabon , rose by 46,000 barrels / day to 33.11 million barrels per day in July .
OPEC also said in its monthly report that low crude prices have prompted global refiners to produce more refined oil , exacerbating the extent of oversupply .
The news , coupled with a US increase in crude oil production expectations and an unexpectedly increased oil inventories , have been falling for two consecutive days .
As of Wednesday , the price of light crude oil futures from the New York Mercantile Exchange fell by 2.48 % in September , and the price of London Brent crude , which was delivered in October , fell 2.07 % .
Reuters said the proposed oil-producing meeting is unlikely to make the supply significantly tighter , and the data released by the US Energy Information agency also depress sentiment .
Iran &apos;s official news agency , Fars , quoted Iran &apos;s oil minister in Wednesday as saying that Iran &apos;s crude oil production was up to 3.85 million barrels a day , the highest level since 2008 .
News of the meeting came just after Russia &apos;s energy minister , Novak Nowak , said there was no need for a new round of frozen production under the current oil price .
The last time a meeting of oil-producing countries was April , OPEC members failed to reach an agreement on any measure .
Emma Richards , Bmiresearch Oil and gas analyst , said markets and media could overreact to OPEC meetings .
Helima Croft , head of commodity strategy at Royal Bank of Canada , said OPEC would change sentiment by releasing signals that they would facilitate the deal .
This approach is like the smoke and mirrors that draw a person &apos;s eye ( intentionally giving the wrong impression ) .
Eugen Weinberg , head of commodity research at Commerzbank , said there was a low likelihood that OPEC would try to stabilize the market through the September meeting .
This is likely to further undermine the market &apos;s confidence in OPEC , after all , the organization has staged a &quot; wolf . &quot;

Diving capital of 12 million yuan , accounting for 40 % of the registered capital , Kyushu Tong Equipment Company contributed 18 million yuan , accounting for 60 % of the registered capital .

During the Cold War , the Soviet Union brought missiles into Cuba , almost leading to a nuclear war between the United States and the USSR .
The incident was seen as the pinnacle of the Cold War , known as the &quot; Cuban Missile Crisis . &quot;
But it is little known that during the Cold War , too , a strong solar storm narrowly led to a nuclear war against the Soviet Union , which was not released for the first time by researchers until August 9 .
May 23 , 1967 , a strong solar storm on the U.S. military in the Arctic radar and radio communications caused strong interference .
These radars are part of the U.S. ballistic missile early warning system to monitor Soviet missiles .
The paper , completed by researchers at the University of Colorado , interviewed U.S. personnel involved in the forecast and analysis of solar activity , and consulted unclassified documents .
In the 60 &apos; s , the United States Air Force has always had a part of a nuclear warhead flying in the sky to prevent the Soviet Union from suddenly waging a nuclear war , the paper wrote .
The US military commanders were unaware that the main culprit of the disturbance was the solar storm , not the Soviet Union , and ordered the fighters to enter combat readiness .
Fortunately , the U.S. military &apos;s solar activity , which began in the late 50 and its study of Earth &apos;s electromagnetic interference , ultimately prevented the potential military conflict .
Later , he summarized the information provided by the United States Air Force Aviation Meteorological Service and submitted a detailed report .
The immediate consequence of this solar storm is that the U.S. military has since seen space weather as a combat concern and has built a more powerful space weather forecast system .

In recent years , China &apos;s capacity utilization rate is higher than the global average level , but also higher than the United States and Europe and other countries and regions .
Our country has taken resolute and effective measures to resolve excess capacity , and the effectiveness is gradually emerging .
The Director noted that the Central Committee of the State Council attaches great importance to the global problem of overcapacity in steel .
Departments , regions actively implement the State Council deployment , serious work , this year to reduce crude steel production capacity of about 45 million tons .
From China &apos;s national conditions , China does not encourage steel exports , on the contrary , also take a series of practical measures to control the export of steel .
The person in charge stressed that the international trade in steel products is essentially market behavior , which is based on the demand of the importing country and the consumers &apos; independent choice after considering the price ratio of products .
The implementation of trade protection measures does not help to fundamentally solve the global steel industry development problems , on the contrary , will only cause further impact on the international trade order .
When it comes to debt , the person in charge stressed that resolving the debt problem is an important issue that needs to be properly handled in the process of resolving excess capacity .

China mainly adopts market mechanism , economic means and rule by law , the Government mainly completes the work of reveals and social stability and ensures fair and impartial market order .
The person in charge stressed that the next step is to unswervingly continue to work on capacity to ensure that the 5-year-old crude steel production capacity of 100 million ~ 500 million tons of target tasks .
