&quot; Environmental problems displays itself in the atmosphere , water , soil pollution , but the root is still in the production of lifestyle . &quot;
For example , in 2015 the land development in Jiangsu Province reached 21 % , which was highest in the autonomous region .
Therefore , the problem of high pollution , large energy consumption and much land occupation has not been fundamentally dealt with in the way of make a change on production and lifestyle .
On the one hand , basing on Jiangsu Province &apos;s creating effect of all levels and types of ecological environment , its absolute advantage should rank first in the country ; but on the other hand , the resource &apos;s environment carried a huge pressure .
Firmly promoting the ecological and environmental protection and governance requires fundamentally push the transformation of production and lifestyle , using ecological civilization building to transform and facilitate people &apos;s livelihood .

Qingdao is the country &apos;s 12th city and also the first city in Shandong Province to experiment with the cap-and-trade emissions trading system .
On 11th , several enterprise representatives went to the Qingdao Emissions Permit Trading Center to submit applications for pollutant emission permits and will pay charges once the applications are processed .
The upcoming deal first single also indicates that Qingdao emissions trading pilot officially kicked off , it will also be the province &apos;s emissions trading first single and the national city-level emissions trading first single .
On the morning of 11th , Zhao Xiuping , general manager of Qingdao Shuangtao Fine Chemical ( Group ) Co . , Ltd . , came to Qingdao Emission Trading Center to submit the emission rights subscription .
At the end of last year , this company completely shut down its plant located in the old city area of Qingdao and gave it an environmentally friendly relocation to a new site in Pingdu .
After Zhao Xiuping submitted the application form , the construction project environmental impact report and other materials , the Qingdao Municipal Emissions Reserve and Trading Service Center began to apply for materials for the first approval process .
According to collection standard determined by the price bureau and finance department of Qingdao , the initial emission fee is currently estimated at 641.2 thousand yuan . The staff will finish review within 7 working days .
The upcoming first single deal also indicates that Qingdao emissions trading pilot project officially kicks off . It will also be the first single deal for province &apos;s emissions trading and the national city-level emissions trading .
Zhao Xiuping said that currently 400 million has been invested on environmental protection , it looks huge , but it has a great impact on the business management philosophy , society benefits , it also explored a space for enterprise innovation management .
On the same day , Qingdao Sifang-Xincheng-Zhizhuo Bus Component Co . , Ltd. also came to buy pollutant emission permit for its project with an annual production capacity of 4200 interior accessories for high-speed train and EMU .
The project belongs to a mechanical processing enterprise , the initial emission rate for the chemical oxygen demand ( COD ) 0.514 tons / year , ammonia ( NOX ) 0.052 tons / year .
Air Pollutant Emission Permits paid use and trading for the city &apos;s electricity , heat production and supply of key industrial enterprises .
The companies certified before January 1 , 2016 are exempted from the levied charges .
&quot; Paid access to emissions is not equal to the power dump illegal sewage , and can not be free to discharge pollutants . &quot;
Qingdao Environmental Protection Bureau deputy director Hongyan Han explains that illegal sewage and excessive sewage are still subject to punishment according to relevant laws and regulations , and it is impossible for illegal enterprises to dodge consequence through the purchase of pollutant emission permits .
In other words , we must crack down on environmental violations and severely punish the corporate organizations for their excessive sewage behavior , through the use of legal means , to protect the environment and public health .
Now for their own interests , enterprises will improve the enthusiasm of pollution control , cherish the limited emissions , reducing pollutant emissions .
With the economic interests as a motive , reducing pollutant emissions changed from the government &apos;s mandatory behavior into a conscious market behavior , to truly protect the environment , protect the natural and protect the public health purposes .
Emission right , also known as &quot; discharge right , &quot; is the right to emit pollutants , which means within the quota allocated by the government , according to law , the emitter has right to discharge pollutants into the environment .
This right is essentially that the polluter occupy , use and benefit the environmental capacity of the resource .
The next step , under the premise that the total discharge of pollutants does not exceed the allowable emissions , internal sources of pollution through the currency exchange between the way the amount of discharge .
Since emissions trading was put forth by an American economist Dyers in 1968 , the US applied it to the atmosphere and river pollution management from the 1970s .
Since 2017 , China has started in 14 pilot areas to carry out the pilot project , which is now totally promoted in Zhejiang , Jiangsu and other provinces ( cities or regions ) .
According to the statement from the Russian Ministry of Defense , in order to assist the six strategic bombers &apos; strikes on ISIS targets in Syria , a number of Russian fighter aircrafts took off from the Khmeimim Air Force base in Syria to provide support and cover to the strategic bombers .
On February 22 this year , United States and Russia reached a ceasefire agreement on the Syrian conflict , The agreement shall become effective on the 27th .
Under the agreement , the ceasefire does not include the military strikes against terrorist organizations determined by the UN Security Council , such as &quot; ISIS , &quot; &quot; Jabhat Fateh al-Sham &quot; and so on .
Russia will continue to build the relevant military infrastructure in the base , so living conditions of the Russian Military will be guaranteed accordingly .
He also added that if we don &apos;t crack down the extremist forces , these forces will extend to Russia .
Although Russia and the West did not reach an agreement on the common fight against extremist forces , Russia would strengthen cooperation with Syria , Iran and Iraq in this area .
In September 2015 , Russia , at the invitation of the Syrian government , began a military strike against Syrian extremist forces .
On March 15 this year , Russia &apos;s main military force in Syria began to withdraw , but the Russian side promised to continue to retain the air station in Heimam and naval base in Tartus .
In the old house and the success of the rural case , He Pei is a good example : a century old house , that also has a story to tell about the heritage of the land .
Today , an average of 10 million people each year flock to Zhushan , whether it is to bring a variety of ideas , or to seek inner peace .
In fact , the country and the city should be accompanied by each other , just like the relationship between mother and child . There should be no arguments about who is stronger or weaker , who should be in the domination . It should be a warm connection .
There is no fixed pattern for rural development , but relying on the villages to develop by themselves is difficult , the most important thing is to let the right people go to the villages .
Shanghai Songjiang District traffic control department recently used electronic police to settle drivers who drive while using their phone , seizing more than 30 cases in one week .
With the popularity of smart phones , mobile phones have brought more and more fun . Browsing WeChat , posting on Weibo and even playing games and shopping Taobao have become routine . It seems that many people cannot live without a mobile phone , even when they are driving .
The Road Traffic Safety Act strictly prohibits the use of mobile phones while driving , as it &quot; prevents safe driving behavior . &quot;
Unfortunately , due to the big number of violators and difficulty to collect evidence , such kind of behavior has not been punished and the regulations of law are useless .
If the traffic control department can be determined to &quot; declare war &quot; to the behavior of playing mobile phones while driving and make a normalized measure , this type of illegal behavior will be stopped .

In the collectively owned big greenhouse of Donglin Village in Taicang City , 48-year-old Wang Xuefen was leading the workers to apply pesticides to the pear trees .
It just needs 12 workers and 1 technical engineer to manage 150 acres of orchards and more than 10 species of trees in the village .
Last year , 50,000 dollars total , for my age , if I work at the factory I certainly can not get the money .
Last year , Donglin village grossed 22 million yuan in village-level income , with agricultural total income accounting for nearly half of VLI .
According to Su Qifang , the village secretary , per capita land cultivation area is increasing every year . It is now over 100 Chinese acres from the initial 50 Chinese acres . The revenue per acre increases yearly and the income of professional farmers also have room for growth year over year .
Quantify the share of each villager . The hightlight of the southern Jiangsu village &apos;s collective economy reform lies in understanding property right of the village &apos;s collective business assets and exploring separate politics and economics .
On July 2015 , Wuxi Xishan District Anzhen street 14 rural economic cooperation organizations and the village committee will start to use &quot; sub-account management , &quot; the village committee will manage rural public affairs , while the cooperative organizations are mainly engaged in business .
Two institutions with two accounts are not mutually &quot; affiliated , &quot; which prevents village cadres from involving in collective asset management , which incurs corruption .
Zhu Baoping , deputy director of the Jiangsu Provincial Agriculture Committee , said that Jiangsu will then continue to promote the reform of community-based share-holding cooperation and encourage farmers to jointly develop and establish a village-level democratic power operation mechanism .
Zhu Baoping : move the reform further forward ; engage in community shares cooperation ; quantify the assets to the members and to the farmers ; and forms the clear property rights .
Through the Internet + , implemented his right to know , the right to participate in decision-making and the right of democratic management to supervise the implementation of the three rights to farmers , it does make it into a standardized mechanism of cooperation .
Presently in southern Jiangsu Province , there are mainly four developing modes in the new collective economy , namely asset-leasing mode , enterprise-shareholding mode , agricultural development mode and joint development mode .

Zhang Binbin , daughter of an ordinary farmer , gains the silver medal in women &apos;s 50 meters rifle three post final of Rio Olympic for China at 11th evening .
On the night of 11th , right in front of this new TV set , Mr. and Mrs. Zhang , along with dozens of relatives and close friends , witnessed the entire thrilling course of their daughter , from almost being disqualified at the preliminaries , to make her way up all along , till the almost successful turnaround at the end .
In the game during the day , Zhang Binbin was ranked in the middle and lower ranks , it seems that the distance to the finals is very far away .
But his parents and friends did not give up , kept freshing the text broadcast , they saw that as the other players finished , Zhang Binbin upgraded his ranking and ultimately lock the final seat , his home broke out a burst of cheers .
In the final , Zhang Binbin ranked lower on the ranking , but the last few guns were more stable , but she won the silver medal by 0.2 ring behind the champion .
27-year-old Zhang Binbin , in her 16 years of shooting career , have almost missed this hard-won silver medal a few times .
His mother Zhang Xiaolong told reporters that when they were hesitating , Zhang Binbin got some &quot; lobbyists &quot; from the same village .
These &quot; novelists &quot; were the village children who were recommended to participate in training at the same time , including Zhang Binbin &apos;s cousin .
Just after entering Xiamen team , because of family financial issues and other reasons , Zhang Binbin once again return to Xiangan school initially .
But after her first coach Zhang Yajie &apos;s repeated attempts , Zhang Binbin returned to the Xiamen team .
After admitted to the provincial team , Zhang Binbin once left and went back home because she waited for a long time for the national team to accept her until she could not see any chance .
This time , not only Coach Zhang Yajie , but also the leaders and coaches of the Xiamen shooting archery sports center have come to her home , and finally persuaded Zhang Binbin to back to the provincial team .
Just like the game yesterday , this Xiamen girl &apos;s insistence staged a series of reverses in her shooting career .
&quot; Each coach uses a different method to pick their players , and when I saw Binbin has a pair of nice hands , I decided my choice . &quot;
As Zhang Donghong recalled , although in the training test , his daughter &apos;s performance was not the best , the number of ring she got was very stable , which was why Zhang Binbin earned the coaches &apos; high opinion .
In the course of training Zhang Binbin Zhang Yajie was impressed with the farm girl &apos;s focus .
He recalled that more than a year after Zhang Binbin joined the Xiamen shooting team , the team carried out a practice where one had to stand holding the gun for half an hour without moving .
Zhang Xiaolong told reporters that her daughter has always been a quiet and well-behaved child , and that she loved painting and making toys herself since her childhood .
&quot; I would make clothes at home , and mend patches here and there , Binbin will pick up the scraps and make her own dolls . &quot;
She said that her daughter often made handmade toys by sewing . Plus , she was very good at painting , so her dolls are as realistic as can be from facial features to clothing .
As an athlete , Zhang Binbin and her family cannot meet up often since she can only go home on holidays , usually they stay in contact via phone calls .
Her parents says , no matter talking in person or over the phone , Zhang Binbin shares with them more about what make her happy instead of how tired she is .
They can &apos;t see their daughter usually , so the parents would carefully keep their daughter &apos;s childhood artworks and previous honors .
Zhang Xiaolong showed his daughter &apos;s cartoon drawings to the reporter and said , &quot; she may have continued to paint if she did not become a shooting athlete . &quot;
There is a cabinet in the second floor living room , which is filled with badges , medals , and certificates awarded to Binbin Zhang .

China &apos;s Mars plan is coming .
China &apos;s Mars exploration mission has to achieve surround , landing , patrol , this form has never been done in foreign countries .
The goal of China &apos;s Mars probe is to achieve orbiting , landing and roving exploration at the same time , and the difficulties are tremendous .
Because an optimal time window for sending spacecraft to Mars occurs once every 26 months , experts are closely working on a plan to launch our first Mars probe during the 2020 launch window .
According to Xu Dazhe , although China &apos;s spacecraft have entered deep space , completion of the Mars exploration mission is still indispensable . The exploration of Mars will mean that China has truly entered the era of deep space exploration .
&quot; Every two or three years , there is one chance that Mars is at its closest to Earth . It is most energy-efficient for the carrier rocket to launch a Mars probe at this time window . &quot;
&quot; Taking into account the quality of Mars detectors , it is decided that Long March 5 Series Launch Vehicle will carry the launch task . &quot; &quot;
China aims to achieve three goals - orbiting , landing and roving exploration - at the same time during its first Mars exploration mission , which has never been done before by other countries . There has been one such attempt to achieve orbiting and landing but it failed .
Mars exploration involves a lot of technologies . The special thing is that although the rover is a space probe , it also has distinctive features compared to the usual space probe .
In other words , the Mars probe has to determine the driving route , and the ability to discover the risk of obstacles .
China Aerospace Science and Technology Group Fifth Group researcher Pang Zhihao said that the reason why human beings so favored for Mars exploration is because the detection of Mars has important scientific , technical and other aspects of significance , and even related to the future of mankind .
Up to now , Mars has become the best studied planet besides Earth , and the history of Mars exploration via space probes almost runs through the history of space exploration .
Therefore , the human beings hope that one day they can establish a base on Mars , and ultimately migrate to Mars , making it a second home for human beings .
A large number of signs also show that Mars was most likely to be the same as the current Earth in the past . It is only after billions of years of evolution that it has become to the current situation with thin atmosphere , low temperature , exhaustion of water source and so on .
Therefore , the detection or manned landing on Mars to study can help to prevent the Earth from turning into a second Mars that humans will have difficulty surviving on .
As of June 2016 , the world had probed the Moon for 114 times and the Mars for 43 times in total .
However , the human has probed the Mars for 18 times in total , while the lunar for only 14 times , since the 1990s to the present .
There are currently five Mars orbiters and two Mars rovers at work , but only one lunar orbiter and one lunar lander at work .
The world &apos;s top space powers have developed a exploring plan with Mars system as the target , that offers you some clues that today &apos;s Mars exploration is still hotter than the Moon exploration .
On November 5 , 2013 , India launched its first Mars probe &apos; Mangalyaan &apos; , becoming the first country to successfully detect Mars in Asia .
&quot; Mangalian &quot; is used to study the surface of Mars , its atmosphere and its mineral characteristics , to explore whether there are signs of methane and life on Mars .
The most difficult part of the mission is that the probe has one and only one chance for profile launch parachute deceleration after it enters the Martian atmosphere .
According to the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation head designer of the Mars probe Sun Zezhou , the Mars exploration task faces many technical challenges .
The atmospheric pressure at Mars is very low , only 1 % of the Earth &apos;s surface atmospheric pressure , with high uncertainty .
Scientists have not thoroughly understood the factors such as its changes and the characteristics of the storm .
In the summer on Mars , it always forms a dust storm similar to dusty weather on earth , which will cause the amount of solar energy that the Mars rover can gain occurs a sharp decline , so the &quot; sleeping &quot; mode must be designed for the Mars rover , so that it can wait patiently until the end of a storm .
At the same time , the Martian atmosphere has a attenuating effect on the sun &apos;s light , which poses a problem for the energy supply for Mars exploration .
This requires the detector &apos;s solar panel to be larger and to be able to constantly strive to adjust its alignment toward the sun .
Besides , the surface gravity on Mars is only about 38 % of Earth &apos;s surface gravity , which is way heavier than that on moon , so the detector needs more power .
&quot; The core task of this Mars exploration mission , which is also the most difficult point , is that after the probe getting into the Martian atmosphere , the deceleration process of the aerodynamic shape and parachute only has one chance , it must ensure success at its first try . &quot;
Sun Zezhou said that because of the distance between the Earth and Mars , the whole process cannot be controlled by the ground at real time , so it must rely on the detector to complete by their own .
Because there is not so much propellant to offset the high speed , so when it lands on Mars , the slowdown process relies on the role of the Martian atmosphere , but the Martian atmosphere is difficult to simulate on the earth .
Pang Zhihao said , in general , the way to detect Mars and the way the moon is similar , but also &quot; around , down , patrol , and back , &quot; and ultimately to achieve the goal of manned landing of Mars .
Since Mars is much more distant from the Earth than the Moon , a number of complex technological hurdles have to be overcome before the actual Mars exploration .
According to Taiwan media reports , Taiwan &apos;s premier Lin Quan announced yesterday morning , &quot; Handling regulations for improperly obtained party assets by political parties and their accompanying organizations &quot; takes effective starting today .
KMT Vice Chairman Zhan QiXian said , &quot; Kuomintang , with a hundred years of history , has social commitment and responsibility , it won &apos;t fall this easily . &quot;
Quan Lin underlined that political parties , collateral organizations or trustee who are in violations of the regulations , the Commission will investigate and punish &quot; according to the law . &quot;
Lin Quan also announced that Hong Pei-gen , &quot; Deputy Director of Agency Against Corruption , &quot; will serve as the candidate for vice chairman of Ill-gotten Party Assets committee .
He said that Gu Lixiong is the best candidate for the chairman of the Committee of improper party assets . Hong Peigen &apos;s experiences on the relevant major cases will serve as the basis for the investigation of this case .
Zhan Qixian thinks that today as long as there are party properties , no one will give out social donations . If all the party properties were confiscated away , the Kuomintang could just ask for social support and sponsorship .

Although not yet confirmed , many sources have claimed that Apple &apos;s 2016 autumn conference will be held in September , iPhone7 is coming soon .
Although Apple did not respond , the information about the functions and configuration of the new iPhone has been released one after the other . The pictures of &quot; real machine model &quot; of the iPhone 7 have even been posted online .
The most recent generation of iPhone can be described as &quot; attention-grabbing , &quot; hot , hard-to-get , out of stock ...... If you want to get your hands on one ASAP , get yours through a good platform like Suning .
This makes people more disappointed at the new iPhone . &quot; It is lengthened , but can not be used to project holographic image ! This generation of iPhone is terrible . &quot;
Just like the other iPhones , the iPhone 7 brings countless secrets before having hit the market .
In addition , there are a number of sources claiming that a new generation of iPhone will cancel the 3.5mm headphone jack , instead , they will use the Bluetooth connection and charging interface , which will provide extra space for Apple to add a second speaker .
Another evidence to support this news is that in 2014 , Apple had already allowed earphone manufacturers to produce earphone products that could be connected through the charging port .
True or false , we will not find out about the answers till the Apple &apos;s 2016 autumn conference .
But this does not prevent the professions in this industry being optimistic about the prospects of iPhone7 - many people think that iPhone7 will be likely to become the last major upgrade of Apple &apos;s iPhone series .
Although the iPhone market share has declined , based on the data published by IDC , a market research firm , not long ago .
Among them , Goldman Sachs gave Apple &apos;s stock a buy rating , and BMO analysts contemplate that iPhone7 would power a historic high sales revenue .
At the same time , Broadcom &apos;s CEO Hock Tan also said that Apple &apos;s future revenue growth will likely be more than 20 % , which is entirely due to the release of the iPhone 7 .
7 % of respondents said they were willing to buy the Iphone 7 , and two years ago only 4 % of people surveyed planed to buy the Iphone 6 .
It is reported that 20 % of the iPhone 6 or the iPhone 6 Plus users plan to buy the iPhone 7 , which is a very high proportion .
Second , according to expert analysis , most of the apple fans are likely to replace their own iPhone every other generation .
According to statistics , of all the iPhone users , about 26 % of them have not changed their phones for 2 years . That is , almost 120 million users have been using the same iPhone for 2 years .
Some media said , during the iPhone7 production period , Taiwan suffered several earthquakes , production facilities of TSMC suffered damage beyond the imagination , which may have an impact on the initial supply of iPhone7 . &quot;
Supply and demand contradictions will affect the average user , it is time to choose a good channel , the first time to buy genuine iPhone7s at a low price .
According to informed sources , the sole purpose of SuNing executives &apos; frequent meeting with Apple top brass recently is to deliver ample supply .
Operators have reached consent with SuNing , so it is foreseeable that , with deep cooperation between the two sides , users definitely will enjoy lower prices and more considerate services .
&quot; At the lowest price , a consumer may &apos; buy iPhone 7 by spending only 7 yuan per day &apos; . &quot;
Ample supply and various discounts makes iPhone7 purchase no more &quot; stressing , &quot; and Suning &apos;s distributing system turns good feelings into great feelings .
You may receive a phone call at midnight and it may say , &quot; Hello , this is Suning , your iPhone has arrived . &quot;

According to foreign media reports , due to diving pool water turning from blue to green , Rio Olympic &quot; green pool &quot; incident recently attracted much attention .
However , on the morning of the 10th , the water polo pool adjacent to the diving pool also turned green .
An Australian water polo player has complained of stinging and teary eyes after the game .
Before that , the official staff of the Rio Olympic Games confirmed the situation of that the pool water had changed into green color , and said that the green color was resulted in due to weakened alkalinity , which would not affect the athletes &apos; health .
However , Australian athletes said their eyes felt tingling after wining a victory over Japanese team in the water polo pool .
Immediately after the diving pool turning green , the game organizers worked overtime on 9th evening trying to solve the problem of diving pool , but in the morning of 10th they found the waterpolo pool color was also rapidly changing .
During the competition between Australian team and the Japanese team , the environmental conditions of the water polo pond gradually deteriorated , but officials stressed that they recover the water quality of the two pools back to the original quality on the 11th .
&quot; Yesterday afternoon , the water alkali level in the diving pool was first weakened , &quot; said Mario Andrada , a spokesman for the Rio Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; We acquaint ourselves with a series of causes that might trigger water discoloration and the alkalinity of water . &quot;
The aquatics center runs a series of water quality tests , and hundreds of divers and swimmers used the swimming pool to ensure the water quality meet standards . &quot;
&quot; These days we have been going through the normal procedures , but we may have overlooked the impact caused by more athletes on water quality . &quot;
&quot; But the change in water color certainly does not affect the health of the athletes . &quot;
&quot; This independent team confirms our assessment and approves the measures we have taken to restore the pool to its normal color and proper chemical status . &quot;
&quot; We had hoped that the swimming pool would be able to return to its original color in the morning , but its speed of recovery was affected by the rain . &quot;

On the morning of August 12 , the State Council Information Office held a press conference on China &apos;s national economy in July 2016 .
National Bureau of Statistics spokesman , Director of National Economic Statistics Division , Sheng Laiyun said that in July , the increase speed of some national economic sector indicators have slowed down , but still run in a reasonable range .
Data released by National Bureau of Statistics shows fallbacks on fixed asset investment growth , total imports and other data in July .
On the run of the national economy in July , I would like to take advantage of the phrase that the Prime Minister once said &quot; the shape is fluctuating and the potential is still good . &quot; This can better summarize the characteristics of the economic operation in July .
He explained that the &quot; ups and downs &quot; meant that part of the economic indicator growth in July had indeed come down .
The export pressure is still relatively heavy , because the domestic and foreign economies were still in the deep adjustment , the international situation was complex and volatile , and the world economic recovery failed to meet expectations in July .
From the perspective of the domestic situation , the whole economy is still in the crucial stage of adjustment , the pain is continuously being released , and the economy is facing a great downward pressure , so there may be still some fluctuations shown by some indicators .
Shenglaiyun pointed out that there is a special case in July , floods are relatively more serious , and high temperature and heat has brought some impact on the production and management in some areas .
According to the Ministry of Civil Affairs &apos; recent release , more than 6000 million people over the country were affected , causing direct economic losses of more than 200 billion yuan .
From the index of industrial , investment , transport-related indicators , these areas are affected to varying degrees .
The cargo turnover growth rate in July fell 3.6 % from last month . Flood disasters have a certain impact on the transportation in these areas .
Based on these factors , the volatility that existed in some indicators was normal in July , and it was not beyond expectation .
He pointed out that &quot; The potential is still good &quot; means even though there is fallback of economic growth , the overall economic performance is steady and on an upward trend .
CPI rises 1.8 % in July , up 0.2 % from last month ; CPI rises 2.1 % from Jun to Jul , so the overall price situation is stable .
According to the statistics of high temperature weather in subsidiary districts and counties provided by the portal of the Chongqing Municipal Bureau of Meteorology , the rest of the metropolis can receive high temperature allowance in various degree except Youyang county .
At present , at least 28 provinces in the country have clearly defined the standard of subsidies , but the standards released by various provinces and municipalities are not the same . Chongqing issues the high temperature allowance according to working under high temperature daily allowance .
The minimum stipend is 10 yuan per person per day when the temperature is below 37 ℃ but above 35 ℃ , and 15 yuan when above 37 ℃
staffs who work in &gt; 40 ℃ temperature can receive an allowance up to 20 yuan per day ( exclude workers that have already been legally granted the high temperature position allowance ) .
According to this standard , Kaizhou that had the most number of hot days last month can get 330 yuan , and Chengkou that had the least can get 80 yuan . Youyang didn &apos;t meet high-temperature standard so it has no high-temperature subsidy .
In the past , many employing units use the cost of cooling beverage to offset the high temperature allowance , which , as pointed out by the City Safety Supervision Bureau , is not line with current stipulation .
Due to high temperature , work was stopped , and working hours shortened , the employer shall not deduct or reduce the wages of workers .
City Council said that employees , who encountered high temperature jobs but did not receive high temperature allowance , can make a claim for your legal right and interest through the enterprise labor dispute mediation agencies , or call 12333 to file complaints .
If the employing unit refuses to pay an allowance for high temperature work , the laborer may lodge a complaint with the relevant bureau of labor and social security at the county level or above .
At the same time the high temperature allowance is included in the total wages and tax deduction since it is part of wages , not welfare .
So the high temperature allowance is not within the minimum wage range , and must be issued in cash form . Drinks and other physical objects cannot be given instead .

Gracia is a adorable female toucan , full of tropical charm .
In the Central American country of Costa Rica , Toucano Gracia and its story has long been known .
After postoperative rehabilitation , &quot; Grecia &quot; the toucan finally appeared to showcase its brand new 3D printing plastic beak at a press conference on August 10 .
This dying toucan whose upper beak was broke one year and half ago now finally regained a new life .
This day it was not only announced that it has 100 % restored its health , but also it has moved into the luxury aviary , and meets human friends everyday .
Recently moving to his new cage , Grecia is slightly shy at first but soon become lively , rolling in the water basin and eating grapes with his new beak .
In order to remind people of what it has suffered , the technical staff did not color the new beak , but to retain the white surface of the original 3D print material .
A bird &apos;s beak is a thin layer of horny sheath , which is hollow inside , and only supported by some interlaced thin bones .
Despite this internal reinforcement , the toucan &apos;s beak is fragile and cloud break when it is hurt .
The animal rescue center , ornithologists and a 3D printing company from US worked together to create several &quot; test beaks , &quot; finally the most suitable &quot; perfect beak &quot; has been created for Gracia .
Today , Gracia has adepted to using the new beak to drink water , eat , and even peck fine grains .
&quot; It took about two months to design the final product , and took only 4 to 5 hours to print . &quot;
&quot; 3D printing is not the future technology , it has really come into our lives.Thomas Lange , chairman of US SG3D printing company , said in an interview with Xinhua International reporters .
On January 2015 , Gracia the Toucan was found completely covered in blood in a farm in the Alajuela canton of Gracia in the middle of Costa Rica .
Its beak was cruelly broken at that time by a group of young people , making it impossible for the bird to eat but to die .
After the media reported on Griscia &apos;s tragedy , there was a tide of anti-animal abuse both inside and outside of Costa Rica .
People are demanding a more rigorous animal protection law with harsher penalties for animal abusers .
People come spontaneously and try their best to help Gracia restore to her life before injury as much as possible .
And even Chuck Hull , the inventor of 3D printing technology , also took part in the design of the Gracia &apos;s beak .
&quot; Gracia &apos;s situation is quite special : the remaining part of its beak is less than 1 centimeter , making it difficult to install the new beak . &quot;
&quot; We first scanned Gracie , and then designed and produced an extended prosthesis slightly longer than the remainder of its beak , and fixed it onto its beak with glue . &quot;
&quot; This can reduce the risk of further invasive injury to Gracia . &quot; Lange told Xinhua International journalists .
Before installing the prosthesis , the staff need to clean the broken beak everyday to prevent infection .
From thousands of miles away , the story of the gray Southeast Asian toucan touched the famous documentary director Paula Heredia and exploration news channel producer John Hoffman .
They recorded the process of installing a new beak on Gracia , recording a documentary named &quot; Toucan country , &quot; which has been broadcast on the Animal Planet this month .
The documentary &quot; Toucan Nation &quot; shows how a small toucan has changed a country and how it has inspired the entire country to get involved in the fight against animal cruelty .
Core Tip : Japanese oil companies stay alert , in particular , to the rising small independent refineries from china that are also known as the &quot; teapot . &quot;
Japan &apos;s largest oil company JX Energy believes that &quot; China &apos;s export expansion is one of the reasons for the downturn in the market . &quot;
Japanese oil companies are especially vigilant about the rise of China &apos;s small independent oil refineries , which are referred to as &quot; teapot . &quot;
China &apos;s oil product quality is gradually close to Japan &apos;s oil due to the Chinese government has always been enforcing the environmental protection requirements .
Before obtaining the crude import license , the &quot; teapot refinery &quot; generally use high-sulfur heavy crude oil from Russian and other places as regular refinery feedstock .
Produced petroleum products have higher sulfur content and poor oil quality , which is one of the causes of environmental pollution .
After gaining the import license for crude oil , &quot; teapot refinery &quot; can import Oman crude oil that has low sulfur content and Russian crude oil , the quality of its petroleum products also improved .
East Fuel General Oil Company reported , &quot; With the continual augment of China &apos;s domestic oil product quality standards , the refining capacity of the equipment improve as well .
As a result , the quality of China &apos;s oil products exported to foreign countries gradually reached the same level as Japan ( which is the world &apos;s highest quality ) .
JX Energy said that &quot; after the end of 2015 , China began to export high-quality light oil to Australia , &quot; and started competing with Japan products in the Asian market .
Although the &quot; Japanese high quality oil &quot; is facing a crisis , the coping strategy the Japanese oil companies use is only to &quot; pay attention to the market while export to profitable areas . &quot;
Due to China &apos;s the influence of exports of oil products on the Asian market , teapot refinery &apos;s attention is also getting higher and higher .

On some nights , the ionosphere is filled with free electrons , which means that the radio signal can go farther .
According to the website of US monthly &quot; Popular Science &quot; that reported on August 11 , the US Air Force is interested in reproducing this effect .
Although the ionosphere having many stable free electrons may help people listen to the university radio station at the edge of broadcast area , it may not be the interest of the U.S. Air Force .
The electron permeated ionosphere means that the radio used by the military has a larger broadcast range and may provide some protection of the global positioning system ( GPS ) signal from a solar storm .
The ultimate goal may be an on-demand fleet of cube-shaped satellites that can reinforce the ionosphere when needed .
But first of all , these teams that signed a contract with the Air Force must prove that the scientific principles will work .

And since February , coal prices gradually picked up , the recent Qinhuangdao thermal coal prices rose continuously for four weeks , rose to the highest in 16 months , and once climbed to 436 yuan per ton , which is 70 yuan more than at the beginning of the year .
With the price rising , the industries across the field accordingly have concerns : Will a group of small coal mine plants resume and work again ?
In this regard , the head of the China ( Hainan ) Reform and Development Institute of Economic Research Kuang Xianming conducted an analysis and interpretation .
Kuang Xianming : Reducing overcapacity has drew intense attention from different parties . The results of reducing overcapacity of the coal industry issued today truly make everyone feel worried .
These three superficial factors reflect the relative lag behind the shift in the way we grow in the past , that is , the government-led growth has not yet been fundamentally changed .
Second , this is also directly relevant to the local government &apos;s executive force , in the process of cutting overcapacity , the funds and the corresponding supporting measures should be in place , from this point of view , the discrepancies between different regions are truly huge .
Thirdly , if some provinces that are relatively slow intended to proceed in the progress in the second half of the year , they might face greater risks .
In this case , the process of promoting overcapacity resolution relying on the funds supported by central government may cause negative impact to a certain extent .
First , &apos; cutting overcapacity &apos; is not a simple total amount control .
Our goal is to reorganize the entire coal industry by eliminating the backward production capacity and promoting industrial structure optimization .
During the deployment aiming to cut overcapacity , the local government must combine the efforts to cut overcapacity with the transformation and upgrading of the coal industry , while striving to develop the relevant services .
Second , to finish this year &apos;s task of reducing overcapacity , we still need to fully execute the power of administrative supervision and regulation .
Last , we want to strengthen the role of social security .
Because the market is directly related to the employment problem , we must strengthen the employment skills training for employees and workers .
&quot; The reason for the declining rank is that foreign investment &apos;s expectation towards the growth of Brazil &apos;s GDP in the medium term has worsened . &quot;
In 2015 , Brazil &apos;s participation in global direct investment was 3.7 % , down from 5.7 % in 2014 .
Credit Suisse Bank International Investment Attractiveness Index includes four sub-indexs : infrastructure construction , economic prospect , business environment and volume of direct investment .
In 2015 , Brazil &apos;s international direct investment was $ 64.6 billion , down from $ 73.1 billion in 2014 .
Last year , Brazil &apos;s &quot; greenfield investment &quot; ( investment in foreign investment to set up factories ) was $ 17.9 billion , 2.1 % lower than last time .
There are 288 &apos; Green Land Investment &apos; projects in Brazil , with an average of 314 per year from 2003 to 2014 .
However , in the first half of 2016 , international direct investment in Brazil had reached $ 33.8 billion , an increase of almost 10 % compared to the same period last year .
Title : Canadian police killed IS supporters : plan to attack downtown with homemade bombs .
The taxi company said this taxi was dispatched to the Dreyfus &apos; residence before the arrival of the police .
Canadian police said at a news conference on Wednesday that the police received information including those provided by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation of the &quot; martyrdom video &quot; the young man was going to execute .
According to the German voice &apos;s report , in the video , a man wearing a black Barakella hat is reading the &quot; Koran , &quot; referring to the crime against the Muslims , and vowed to attack a Canadian city soon .
He said in the video , that the attack would occur within 72 hours and at the rush hour .
The incident is the first time the police shot a suspected terrorist before an incident since Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau ( Justin Trudeau ) came to power last year .
After upgrading , Old Wanfu River and North Pass , feeder canals of the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal , will begin toll collection since September 1 .
The fund for transformation of two tributaries comes from social financing , which has been approved by the relevant provincial government departments .
Flowing through Jinxiang , Yutai , the Lao Wan Fu water way drifts into the main channel of Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal via Lake Nanyang , with a total length of 32.5 km .
According to the navigation needs , method of conservative transformation was used on the Old Wanfu River channel like deepening the local depth of the water , straightening the local sharp bend so on , therefore navigation conditions can be improved .
The channel flows through Jinxiang County , Rencheng County , and enters the main channel of Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal through Nanyang Lake , a total length of 19 km .
Renovation of the two waterway started construction in February 2011 , and was completed and inspected in January 2015 , investment and construction was supported mainly by the Jining Anping Canal Logistics Service Center .
In accordance with the &quot; loan construction , charging repayment &quot; principle , Jining City Anping Canal Logistics Service Center , in accordance with the Shandong Provincial Price Bureau , approved the proposed price of the channel tolls .
Among them , the basic toll is 1.75 yuan / dwt and mileage fee is 0.05 yuan / dwt-km .
The toll collection date is from June 15 , 2016 through June 14 , 2019 .
Reporters from Jining City harbor learned that there is a total of four charged flight channels . They are Zhushui waterway , Baima River Channel , North Road channel , and the old channel respectively .
These four channels are tributary channels of Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal , and were upgraded and rebuilt through social financing .
The upgrading project of Zhushui River waterway is the first one to adopt the &quot; government + market &quot; model in construction of the inland port infrastructure in Shandong Province . The government accounts for the main investment and the social funds are used to fill its budget deficit .
Baima River , the old Wanfu River , North River Road and other feeder routes take the pure market operation way .
Lack of funding allocated by the State Finance has been a major constraint on the upgrading project of the channel .
Utilizing Social funds for the construction of public infrastructure not only conforms to the requirements of national policies , but also offers a way to break the capital bottleneck .
Ningze Tao &apos;s performance in the 100 meters freestyle semi-final , has left a lot of Chinese audience speechless .
But in the preliminary contest of 50-meter freestyle swimming , Ning Zetao refreshed the &quot; bottom line &quot; of people once again .
In fact , 50 meters freestyle is not Ning Zetao &apos;s advantageous projects , his performance and the best result he got in the Kazan World Championships also decided his breakthrough in this project is unlikely .
Sure enough , Hong Kong media authority &lt; Ta Kung Pao &gt; revealed that the biggest reason Ning Ze Tao lost is because he has lost interest in swimming .
Many off-court factors may have a great impact on his future ideas , he is likely to be more interested in entering the entertainment .
After getting the Kazan World Championships , with his ultra-nice looking and good score , Ning Zetao instantly become a network celebrity .
So , the titles such as &quot; national husband , &quot; &quot; little fresh meat , &quot; &quot; metrosexual &quot; and so on continuously become his labels .
A variety of commercial activities and opportunities of making big money led to a promising future .
In this case , Ning Zetao can chooses to retire at this time to join the entertainment , it is not only his freedom , but also a seemingly viable way .
After all , he is only 23 years old . After some serious study , he can definitely star in one or two dramas with his popularity .
But Ning Zetao needs to see whether he is qualified enough compared to these predecessors .
At the 2000 Sydney Olympics , 21 years old Liu Xuan has come to the final phase of her professional athlete &apos;s career .
Liu Xuan &apos;s beautiful appearance makes people remember her quickly , which paves the way for her entertainment career .
After retirement , Liu Xuan played in a number of TV series , and set up her own studio in 2013 .
Tian Liang participated in Olympic individual and Synchronized 10 metre platform diving events twice and won 2 gold medals and 2 silver medals .
But after losing in the 2004 Olympic Games singles 10m dive against teammate Hu Jia , Tian Liang &apos;s competition performance showed a decline , and was revealed to be kicked out of the diving team .
And he drew lots of attention by participating in variety shows , such as &quot; Where Are We Going ? Dad &quot; with his daughter .
Once the gymnastics gold generation Yang Wei , Li Xiaopeng and Chen Yibing are high-profile participating in a variety of variety shows .
It is worth mentioning that , Yang Wei and Li Xiaopeng led China to win the 2008 Olympic Games men &apos;s team champion , Yang Wei even earned a personal all-around gold medal twice , and is known as the Almighty King .
And Yibing Chen led the Chinese team to the 2012 Olympic team champions while at the same time became &quot; King of the Rings . &quot;
And in the London Olympic Games , after losing the gold medal because of being misjudged , Chen Yibing &apos;s generous move let him win numerous fans .
But these athletes mainly put their energy in the games . As for the variety shows , they are not serious about them .
But whether it is retired or active athletes , they can get recreation when needed while receiving proper protection .
After all , athletes , who have just stepped into a new area , are in a blank state in terms of ability and social network .
Even the &quot; veterans &quot; like Tian Lian and Liu Xuan who have been around in the entertainment circle for years , they still remind common audience of their performance in the Olympic Games .
When introducing the newbies to the variety show , they are Yang Wei , Li Xiaopeng and others . All of them are &quot; Olympic champions &quot; without any exceptions .
Comparing with the people above , Ning Zetao &apos;s only one world swimming champion seems fewer .
Moreover , compared to Tian Liang , Liu Xuan , Yang Wei , etc who retired with glories , if Ning Zetao quits at age 23 after some minor setbacks in his career , it would cause immeasurable negative impact on his image .
After all , when talking about athletes , people &apos;s requirements are &quot; not winning all the time , but to not be afraid of danger , &quot; Ningze Tao is also a lot worse from this requirement .
To put it in another way , Ning Zetao looks handsome so he can use it to earn countless crazy fans &apos; support .
Want to have a good showbiz career , but have no talent but a good appearance . It is more difficult than return to original state by hard training .
The choices made in life depends on an individual &apos;s wishes , but in the end , Ningze Tao should make the choice himself .
The network social platforms ostensibly expand the social circle while reducing people &apos;s loneliness .
The influence of online social network is getting more and more extensive , it &apos;s not only gradually replacing the traditional telephone communication , but also penetrating into our offline real life circle , quietly changing the current social activity of people .
The benefits of online socialization are obvious , such as convenience and fast , so it is particularly favored by young people .
A survey on social habits of college students shows that 57 % of college students use mobile phones for more than five hours a day , and they can not even leave their mobile phones in their daily lives .
&quot; Social network features low cost , fast transmission , multi people instant communication and so on , which is in line with the needs of contemporary college students . &quot;
Expanding social circle , talking with each other more equally and avoiding social anxiety , those are the main reasons why we fall in love with online chat .
New entrants who have just entered the company like online chatting with other colleagues , &quot; they are not familiar with each other because they have just entered the company , however their relationships are getting closer than before through giving likes and comments to each other on the social platform . &quot;
Those who love to make friends commonly use online communication . &quot; Before with friends if there was some misunderstanding it would take some time to work it out . Later , just a few lines exchanged with a large group and they warm right up . &quot;
As an IT engineer , Wu Yan is one of in-depth online social enthusiasts , most of his social life has occurred online , the number of his online contacts is several times of his offline friends .
Wu Yan himself admitted that he is as free &quot; as a duck &quot; on the Internet .
&quot; You can reply to your friends when you are willing and convenient , because there are a lot of time to consider the words , the expression can be more clear . &quot;
&quot; The coming and going hidden under the ID avoids face-to-face interpersonal collision , this does not only leave room for maneuver , and even give each other more time and space to consider words and deeds . &quot;
&quot; People of different identities have the same right and efficiency in the same way that all social concerns in real life seem to be eliminated in cyberspace . &quot;
However , Wuyan &apos;s friend Xiaopeng feels that the real life Wuyan is a &quot; rather boring geek . &quot;
Xiaopeng and Wu Yan made acquaintances in a big chatting group , they both were active speakers , so got familiar with each other very soon .
Xiaopeng thinks Wuyan is very different in real life and on the computer . His speech is simple , he does not take the initiative to express his views , and all he says is &quot; Oh , yes , yes , &quot; or else it would be , &quot; I will need to check the Internet for this &quot; many times repeatedly .

On August 11 , when the reporter telephone interviewed Huang Yilin who has returned to her home in Mianyang , Sichuan , she said : &quot; At that time the situation was too urgent , and there was only saving people on my mind ! &quot;
Huang Yilin is a student in class 2015 of College of the Central and South Forest Science and Landscape Architecture .
Huang Yilin , who majors in urban and rural planning , wanted to visit Sichuan Langzhong to observe the local architectural design , so the family traveled there .
On August 8th , around 10 am , Huang Yilin &apos;s father rested in the hotel , mother and daughter went out and prepared to stroll in Langzhong ancient city .
I didn &apos;t go far before suddenly seeing a crowd of people hollering , and I went over merely out of curiosity .
Seeing &quot; a little boy disappear and a little girl desperately flutter in the water , only can see her little head on the surface of the river and she continues to sink , &quot; Huang Yilin ( who has learnt swimming at childhood ) hurriedly jumped into water to save them .
After entering the water , Huang Yilin with the height of 165 cm found that she actually cannot touch the bottom !
Below the calm water surface , it is the rapids !
However she still desperately swam to the little girl .
Yilin Huang said the last 5 meters in the muddy and racing flood-water almost worn her out .
She tried her best to push the little girl to the dock , &quot; the slope is particularly slippery , I am afraid that I would not have the strength to stay afloat . &quot; &quot;
So , Huang Yilin started to seek help from her mother , when her mother who is not good at swimming heard her daughter &apos;s shout she prepared to rescue her in the water , but she was stopped by the visitors around her .
News spread when on August 10th Huang Yilin jumped into the river to save someone . Ms. Yin received both condolences and praise from friends and relatives , but many of them also held her &quot; accountable . &quot;
&quot; Now that I think about it , it &apos;s really scary ! To tell the truth , when the child couldn &apos;t stay on the embankment any longer , and asked for my help , my heart was almost broken . &quot;
Ms. Yin said with some trepidation that , despite the danger , if again faced with the same situation she will still support her daughter &apos;s choice . She is proud of her !
Because she was forced to learn to swim , Huang Yilin seldom swims after that . &quot; I have never thought that the skill would come in handy . &quot;
According to the introduction from Huang Yilin &apos;s class supervisor Chen Yijun , Huang Yilin is recognized as a &quot; curve wrecker &quot; in the class and helpful .

Siberian tigers are currently classified as endangered ( EN ) by the World Conservation Union ( IUCN ) Red List of Endangered Species .
According to the Jilin Provincial Forestry Department , in 1998 , China , the United States , Russia and other countries jointly gathered data which showed that Jilin Province only had four to six wild Northeastern tigers , and three to five Northeastern leopards .
According to Changchun Yu , the Director of Jilin Provincial Department of Forestry Protection , Jilin Province has continuously amplified wild animal conservation in recent years 。 The distribution and number of both Northeast Tiger and Northeast Panthers in China are much improved .
The latest monitoring data of year 2015 shows that only within Jilin Province we have monitored 27 wild tigers and 42 Northeast leopards .

Sun Fijian , as a party member and leading cadre , has lost his ideal and faith and seriously violated party disciplines . After 18th National Congress , he is still seriously overbearing , and against discipline with no sense of proportion .
After the occurrence of this case , after a number of media reports , the case became the center of focus , causing an extremely bad impact on society .
After the case , Haikou City Public Security Bureau of Interpol detachment leaders greatly valued this case and immediately organized a detachment of elite troops to take the initiative to attack .
The police immediately implemented the Internet pursuing of the suspect and took a variety of measures to make surveilance , and contacted and asked foreign police to assist in investigation of the whereabouts of Wang .
As the suspect is notorious thieves , and have repeatedly been dealt with by the public security organs , with strong anti-reconnaissance capabilities , coupled with his long-term drug abuse , interrogation of drug addiction often attack , trial work is very difficult .
The Greenland Shark , also known as small head sleeping shark , is widely distributed in Greenland and Iceland in the North Atlantic waters ; these sharks can reach 4 to 5 meters long as adults .
But their growth rate is extremely slow , sometimes only about 1 cm a year , suggesting that Greenland sharks may have an extremely long lives .
Traditional aging methods usually uses animal &apos;s calcification , and with regard to sharks we can use fins , but this kind of calcified tissue is very scarce in Greenland sharks .
A new study led by Julius Nelson of the University of Copenhagen ， Denmark resorted to the use of Greenland shark &apos;s ocular lens for radioactive carbon dating .
This methodology had previously been used to validate the age of whales , but it is the first time for it to be applied in sharks and other fish .
Their analysis shows that age estimate of the largest shark is 392 years old with a margin of error of 120 years .
That is to say , the age of this shark is at least 272 years old ; possible maximum of 512 years old .
In addition , the female Greenland shark allegedly to about 4 meters in length when the sexual maturity , converted into age is at least until the age of 156 only adult .
Researchers therefore state in the paper that the Greenland sharks are the known reigning champions of vertebrate longevity , surpassing the previous longevity champion record of Bowhead whales ( 211 years ) .
Over the past year , the exchange reform has achieved remarkable results , while the RMB exchange rate remained basically stable , but it also laid a solid foundation for the promotion of RMB internationalization .

The last remittance measure before &quot; 8.11 &quot; exchange reform was conducted in 2005 . The appreciation of RMB against US dollars was substantial for the last 10 years .

In late August , Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will go to Kenya to attend the Sixth African Development Conference , according to the Voice of China &quot; News Evening . &quot;
The African Development Conference was dominated by Japan . The previous five meetings were held either in Tokyo , Japan or Yokohama Japan , therefore this conference will be the first to be held in Africa .
Officials from Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan said the meeting held in Africa would be conducive to drawing more attention to Japan from African and European countries .
In line with Shinzo Abe &apos;s visit , according to Kyodo news agency , the Japanese Liberal Democrats will send parliamentary groups to the countries concerned .
Japan &apos;s &quot; often &quot; road began in the early 90s of last century , and by the African-sponsored African Development Conference also began in 1993 , this is not a coincidence !
Africa has 53 seats and plays a role of an important ticket warehouse in the United Nations , is there any reason why Japan gives up Africa if they want to &quot; become a permanent member &quot; of the United Nations ?
and will also exchange opinions on strategies against extreme organization &quot; ISIS &quot; and terrorist activities with relevant people from various countries .
&quot; Western Group &quot; will visit Sierra Leone , Liberia , Guinea Bissau and other seven countries .
Mr. Fumio Kishida , Minister for Foreign Affairs of Japan , has recently stated the intention at the UN Security Council meeting in regard to the international Conference of African Development .
Abe has announced here that for the stability of sub-Saharan African countries , 100 billion yen ( about 6.1 billion yuan ) will be provided in a period of five years .
Observers generally believe that Japan has always had two purposes for Africa &apos;s generosity : first , to increase Japan &apos;s presence in Africa ; and second , to win the support of African countries on its bid for a permanent UN security council seat .
Japanese problem expert , Yang Bojiang , said : &quot; From a political perspective , although Africa relatively lagged behind , there are relatively many countries . Therefore , Japan has always regarded it as the so-called &apos; big vote pool . &quot; &quot;
From now on , Japan will not give up , and its diplomatic efforts with Africa will not falter , but continue to grow stronger .
Economically , Japan &apos;s domestic demand is relatively low because its production capacity is relatively strong , but the domestic market is relatively limited , especially in the context of the aging of the population ,
However , from Junichiro Koizumi 10 years ago , to Abe 10 years after , during which Japan has repeatedly launched the &quot; sprint , &quot; but returned defeated every time .
Japanese expert Yang Bojiang thinks that Japan &apos;s usual intention can be seen through at a glance , but often the road is bound to be difficult .
In order for Japan to achieve their goals , first of all , they have to have good ties with the neighboring countries , which includes , geopolitical competition or the national dispute and historical knowledge , Japan needs to have the correct attitude .

&quot; I came across information about this special holiday on the Internet , so I decided to come and take a look . Well it is quite unique . &quot;
They remark that although there are ancestors honoring festivals like this in France as well , the atmosphere is much ponderous , nothing like here . Here you get music , food , and opportunities to learn traditional crafts .
She said , &quot; it is marvelous to be able to witness such a large-scale and well organized ancestor worship ritual in a busy financial metropolis like Hong Kong . &quot;

Provincial Standing Committee , Sanya Municipal Party Committee Secretary Zhang Qi , Vice Governor Wang Lu , the provincial government secretary Lu Zhiyuan to participate in research seminars .
In her 14 years of sporting career , Deng Yaping won a total of 18 world championships , becoming the first person in Chinese Olympic history who won four Olympic gold medals .
She has ranked world no.1 table tennis player for eight years and is a female athlete who holds &quot; world no.1 &quot; title with the longest span in the history of table tennis .
On September 26 , 2010 , he served as the Deputy First Secretary of the People &apos;s Daily and the CEO of the People &apos;s Search Network Co . , Ltd . , cadres at department-level .
Recently , she will work together with Yu Minhong to build the first domestic sports industry innovation and business platform .
There is a group of celebrity trainers in China sports filed ： They were extremely famous when they were athletes and helped the country win numerous proud awards . After retirement , they impart what they have learned for years to newcomers to nurture Chinese champions .
As the first Chinese men &apos;s gymnastics world champion , Huang Yubin chose to be a teacher after retirement .
From the women &apos;s team coach to the men &apos;s team coach , and then to the head coach , Huang Yubin created an &quot; Olympic gold group , &quot; and led his team in the Beijing Olympic Games to win 9 gold 1 silver 4 copper medals .
Since then , Tian Liang has been doing advertising endorsement . He has even played &quot; Cowherd , &quot; &quot; Lei Feng &quot; and other important roles in recent years .
Many NBA players have proved their strength.But along with the people who progress , there will be some who will decline .
Whether because of increasing age or limited playing time , some players will have regression in their performance each season .
Of course , some &quot; regression &quot; may just be the shrinkage of data . These players &apos; strength may have not declined .
Wade would not perform with Bulls as good as he did with Heat , although he is still one of NBA &apos;s best shooting guard .
He and Rondo composed of the back court whose shooting range is limited , leading star Butler &apos;s three point hit rate is only 32.8 % , which makes their next season &apos;s attack be very crowded .
Coming to the Wind City , the Flash Wede will certainly give more ball dominants to Butler and Rondo , he is likely to choose &quot; healthy play &quot; in the regular season .
Okafor &apos;s situation is a little embarrassing , as the first pick out of 76ers last season , he now has to compete against Simmons and Enbiid in the new season for playing time and ball rights .
This competition may not come soon , because Simmons still need to get used to the NBA stadium environment , and Enbiid also need to be fully recovered from the injury as soon as possible , but it is still a question that if Okafor can obtain a position in the giant array of 76 people .
Last season , 32 % of Okafor &apos;s score is from low post offense , which is higher than that of Cousins , Vucevic and Brook Lopez . And his usage percentage is also the top 40 in the league ..
As Simmons has shown a great potential for a striker and Nbeide has a body more suitable for the NBA game , Okafor &apos;s position is not going to be as sturdy as before .
Over the past two seasons , Thompson &apos;s usage has stabilized in the league &apos;s top 20 , and these are the best two seasons of his career as well .
But the problem is that as Durant joins the team , Thompson &apos;s playing time will decline , which is bound to affect his performance .
It will not only affect Thompson &apos;s number of shots , his personal holding attack will certainly be greatly reduced in next season , which will , to some extent , reduce the difficulty of the opponent &apos;s defense on him .
Durant &apos;s arrival will certainly cause the Warriors &apos; players &apos; data to shrink , the most serious of which is probably Thompson &apos;s .
It doesn &apos;t mean Thompson &apos;s skill level is regressing , it seems more like that he sacrifices something in favor of his team .
Parker had a better performance than it looked on paper last season , not only because of his career high efficiency on low post , but also the benefits to the Spurs from his good chemistry with Aldrich .
Duncan retires , Ginobili announces that he would play for another year , the GDP combination eventually come to an end . As the youngest of three people , Tony Parke does not have much fuel left in his &quot; French sports car tank . &quot;
After getting the third championship ring , only Kareem Abdul-Jabbar , Jordan and Russellby James won more regular season MVPs , while Jordan was the only one who had more FMVP than James .
Oh , yes , James has just brought the first professional sports championship trophy to Cleveland in the past 52 years .
In the 14th season of his career , James needs to better ensure physical strength , and get ready for the playoffs .
Therefore , in the regular season , James &apos;s point is likely to further decline , and he will let Owen to share more heavy loads . But he will still easily become one of the league &apos;s top three players .
&quot; We must carry forward the talents and skills that we have learned from our country in Russia . &quot;
Local time on the 12th , Jing Huang , the president of the Moscow Overseas Chinese Association , told the China News Service reporter emotionally .

After returning to Moscow , we must make our own contribution to the spread and promotion of Chinese culture , utilizing the knowledge and skills that we have acquired .
Russian Chinese Culture Association Secretary-General Yan Wei , who also attended this training course , also has the same feeling .
She said that she made huge progress with the help of the training teacher , and felt the responsibility of being an &quot; oversea advocate of Chinese culture &quot; at the same time .
Then Yan Wei said that when he returned to Russia , he would spread and bring awareness to the traditional Chinese culture to the Chinese as well as those who love the Chinese culture in Russia .

Unfortunately , according to OPEC &apos;s latest monthly report , crude oil production in July continues to climb up and the production in Saudi Arabia hit a new record high .
The report causes the market doubt the credibility of OPEC . The road to recover oil price is still full of thorns .
On Monday , OPEC Chairman and Qatar Energy Minister Sada said OPEC will hold an informal meeting during the International Energy Forum on September 26-28 .
OPEC Wednesday &apos;s monthly report shows that the production from the entire OPEC organization , including Gabon , rose from 46 thousand barrels / day to 33.11 million barrels / day in July .
OPEC also said in the monthly report , low crude oil prices have prompted the global refinery to produce more refined oil , thus increasing the degree of excess supply to the market .
Affected by this news , coupled with the fact that the United States raised crude oil expected volumes of production and an unexpected increase in crude oil inventories , international oil prices fell for two consecutive days .
As of Wednesday &apos;s close , the price of light crude oil futures which will be delivered by New York Mercantile Exchange in September fell 2.48 % , the price of London Brent crude oil futures which will be delivered in October fell 2.07 % .
Reuters believes that the proposed oil-producing countries meeting is unlikely to significantly tighten supply , the data the US Energy Information Administration published can also suppress the market sentiment .
Iran &apos;s official news agency Fars on Wednesday quoted Iranian oil minister Zangan &apos;s speak that Iran &apos;s daily crude oil production is up to 3.85 million barrels , which is the highest level since 2008 .
As soon as the news of the meeting came out , the Minister of Energy of Russia Novak said that there was no necessary to launch a new round of negotiation about the oil production freeze in terms of current oil price .
The last meeting of the oil-producing countries was already a matter of April , and OPEC members failed to reach settlement on any measures in that meeting .
Emma Richards , an oil and gas analyst at BMI Research , said the market and the media could react excessively to OPEC &apos;s meeting .
Helima Croft , head of commodity strategy at Royal Bank of Canada , said that the OPEC will change the market sentiment by releasing the signal indicating they are willing to make the agreement .
The means draws people &apos;s attention away just like the way a smoke or a mirror does ( deliberately giving a false impression ) .
Eugen Weinberg , director of commodity research at the German Commercial Bank , said the possibility of OPEC trying to stabilize the market through the September meeting was low .
This is likely to further weaken the market &apos;s confidence in OPEC . After all , this organization cried &quot; wolf &quot; once .
All localities should be focused on medical institutions in this spot check who has issued illegal medical advertising , has been frequently complained on the past and has repeatedly been punished .
National Health Commission and the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine will be organizing timely supervisions on the carry-out of supervision and inspection work of some provinces .
According to media disclosure , the large influx of capital into the Internet medicine has resulted in a serious problem of current product homogeneity. investment boom has faded gradually , and capital has got into the wait-and-see period .
According to the data of Hong Kong Ai Li Pi Hospital Management Research Center , a large number of Internet medical company established within a year died , about 20 % of the start-up Internet medical business has ceased to exist .
However , while the majority of Internet medical companies are struggling in the A or B round of financing , there are several areas that can still lead an enterprise to acquiring capital .
It seems not wise to rush into the online healthcare industry . The key to success is to forecast potential market demand , and to specialize in just some areas .
Diving invested 12 million yuan , accounting for 40 % of the registered capital , Kyushu Tong equipment company invested 18 million yuan , accounting for 60 % of registered capital .
In recent years , with the country &apos;s medical information policy support , electronic , integrated supply chain management system gradually into all levels of hospitals .
The cooperation between Yule and Kyushu is aimed at the needs of the market , helping the hospital to build advanced supply chain management system , and as an opportunity to seek more cooperation .
Different from a lot of Internet medical companies , iBaby was initially focused on the Internet obstetrics vertical fields and deeply reaching out to both pregnant women and doctors .
Pregnant women can enjoy not only free 24-hour one-on-one inquiries with the primary doctor , but also paid medical counseling with specialists .
At the doctor &apos;s side , iBaby breaks the geographical restrictions by taking the form of micro-lectures by organizing experts to give grassroots doctors an on-line lecture , peer exchange , case discussion and so on .
At present the doctor front section opens three plates , which respectively is doctors &apos; continual education , doctors &apos; social and doctors &apos; seeking for help .
The provided services include online learning , patient case discussions , academic exchange , social platform for doctors from within or across departments within a same hospital , legal aid and entrepreneur support needed by doctor-patient relationship or personal life .
According to media reports , CEO Wang Lei recently said Ali is healthy and that he is &quot; willing to concentrate &quot; to win big health data .
Internet companies and data companies lack expertise and can &apos;t agree on a way to write the same entry .
Ali &apos;s current layout in the field of medical health is divided into three parts , they are Ali Health , Tmall Medicine Shop and Alipay Future Hospital .
Wang Lei admitted that medical and health startups will be more difficult than other industries , &quot; This is not only about how much money you &apos;ll invest in , but also about the determination , loneliness and patience required in the process . &quot;

This event is seen as the peak of the cold war , known as the &quot; The Cuban missile crisis . &quot;
But little is known that during the Cold War , a powerful solar storm has nearly led the United States to the brink of nuclear war with the Soviet Union . This incident didn &apos;t open to the public until being announced by researchers for the first time on August 9 .
On May 23 , 1967 , a strong solar storm caused strong interference to the radar and radio communications of the US military in the Arctic .
These radars are part of the US Ballistic Missile Early Warning System for monitoring Soviet missiles .
This paper was written by researchers at the University of Colorado , who interviewed US military personnel involved in the forecasting and analysis of solar activity and reviewed non-confidential documents .
According to the paper , the US Air Force had kept some of their fighters which contained nuclear warheads flying in the sky in order to prevent the Soviet Union from suddenly launching a nuclear war in the 1960s .
The US military commander didn &apos;t know that the interference was made by the solar storm rather than the Soviet Union , so he ordered the fighters to get into the combat readiness state .
Fortunately , the research focusing on solar activity and its interference with the Earth launched by the US military in the late 1950s eventually prevented from the potential military conflict .
Later , he summarized the information provided by the Air Weather Service and submitted a detailed report .
The direct consequence of this solar storm is that the US military has seen space weather as a combat concern and has built a stronger space weather forecast system .

This is the day when the US Defense Secretary Carter , US Secretary of State Kerry , Japanese Foreign Minister Yasuhiko Kawada and Japanese Defense Minister Nakayama Yuen were in New York to attend a press conference .
This is the fifth time that China &apos;s civilian think tank published a report assessing the power of Japanese and also the fourth launch of the English version .
The report has nine chapters , including the overall policy adjustment , military strength , defense budget , military deployment , weapons and equipment , system reform , military training , foreign military security cooperation , military security relations with China and so on .
It is reported that 2015 is the last stage of the year in which Abe administration has improved major policy adjustments in the security field for years .

Complement the flaws of public sports facilities
Dark coal warehouse , turned into a &quot; green grass &quot; football field ; red brick spire plant , turned into a modern sports museum .
On national fitness day at the South Luoma sports complex outside the Wangjiang gate in Hangzhou , a mystery was revealed .
It was once the coal field , more than 10 years ago after it was closed , leaving behind numerous illegal construction and garbage .
After the renovation , this land becomes a sports culture park , and will officially open to the public in November . Allowing residents to access sports venues for free surely has opened up a new fertile soil for the flourishing of the national sports .
This can not help but think of Hangzhou Chen Jinglun sports school , the Chinese swimming &quot; Whampoa Military Academy &quot; came out a few of world champion .
Famous swimmers will continue to be born , which vividly interpreted the relationship between competitive sports and national sports - the rich base of professional players provided for good conditions .
The level of competitive sports is closely related to the foundation of national sports . Athletic sports depends in a certain sense on national sports , and national sports depends on the conditions of the site .
According to reports , as of 2015 , China &apos;s per capita sports venues , although is 150 times larger than when China was first established , is still far behind strong sports countries .
In June this year , the State Council issued a &quot; National Fitness Program ( 2016 - 2020 ) , &quot; and will develop mass sports as a key content .
In order to make up this shortcoming , on the one hand , the relevant departments should take full account of the layout of the sports stadiums during city planning .
On the other hand , public sports venues , including those in schools and other places , should extend the open hours and open for public as much as possible to improver facilities usage .
The ongoing Rio Olympic Games stimulates people &apos;s enthusiasm for the sports , and awakens everyone &apos;s sense of participation .
After the little life comes to this world , parents will be responsible for this life , which not only lies in the child &apos;s health , but also spiritual development , which is so-called education .
If children &apos;s education fails , no matter how successful a career is , it can not make up for an incomplete life and a frustrated family .
When a new life arrives , the new parents need to spend time to take care of and educate their children , and be responsible for him .
Being responsible parents means to nurture the mind and the spirit of your children in addition to taking care of their body and keeping them healthy physically . In another word , to let the children learn how to behave , how to social , how to grow up , and how to succeed .
Good family education means that parents need to regularly accompany their children , give them love , patiently take care of them . They also need to teach children civilized behavior , let the children better learn knowledge , and enhance intelligence .
Parents &apos; words and deeds will affect the growth of their children , they will imitate their parents , that is , people often say dragons will give birth to dragons , phoenixes will give birth to phoenixes , the son of the mouse will dig , what kind of child will have what kind of parents .
So parents need to be a good example in front of children , to regulate their own words and deeds , to develop their own excellent character , which can indirectly help children to create a good heart , so that he is more excellent .
Amy is a smart girl .
She is outgoing and gets along well with friends . She also fits in well in a new environment .
But Amy has a little secret : she cannot concentrate on things she wants to learn and work she wants to do for a long period .
This secret has been with Amy for a long time.Usually the problem is not serious &quot;
Even with decentralized and modularized time to learn and work , she basically could complete the task and achieve good results .
However , when the task is heavy and time is pressing , Amy feels very painful and tortured .
The purpose of individual &apos;s resistance to self-exposure and his emotional experience is to protect the individual &apos;s self-awareness and self-esteem from threatening .
And some behaviorist psychologists think of the impedance as an individual &apos;s disobedience to their behavioral corrections .
I tried to make Amy practice and let her clam herself down by relaxedly breathing to feel the struggle .
And once she left the trapped situation , she felt relaxed and regained freedom .

National Development and Reform Commission , said the person in charge of the Department of Industry Coordination here , the iron and steel production capacity is a global problem .
In recent years , China &apos;s rate of capacity utilization has been higher than the global average and that of the countries and regions in the United States , Europe and so on .
China has actively taken firm and effective measures to resolve excess capacity , and the impacts are gradually emerging .
The person in charge said that the State Council of the Party Central Committee pays high attention to this global problem regarding the steel industry overcapacity .
All departments and regions actively implement the deployment of the State Council , earnestly carry out work , this year we will reduce crude steel production capacity of 45 million tons .
With China &apos;s national conditions in mind , China does not encourage steel exports . On the contrary , it also takes a series of practical measures to control steel exports .
The person in charge stressed that , the international trade of steel products in essence is one of market behaviors , which is not only derived from the needs of the importing country , but also the choice made by the consumers after they comprehensively consider a set of factors such as the cost performance .
The implementation of trade protection measures does not help to fundamentally solve the issues existing in the global steel industry development , on the contrary , it will only cause further impact on the order of international trade .
Speaking of debt , the person in charge stresses that solving debt problem is an important issue needed to be handled well during the process of solving the excess capacity .
Because of the large scale of steel enterprises , the wide range impact and the complexity of enterprise debt relationship , if it is not properly disposed , it would lead to regional risks .
According to the person in charge , in recent years , with the pressure from economic downturn increasing and the total needs of society gradually decreasing , part of the industry capacity utilization has declining , and the production and management difficulties has risen .
Some enterprises do not adapt to the changes in the market and can hardly manage and produce and even are on the brick of folding up . Due to some institutional factors , however , these enterprises face relatively many obstacles when exiting under market mechanism . They become &quot; zombie enterprises . &quot;
Because of the existence of these firms , the market signal was distorted , the usability of factor resources was reduced , and social management costs were increased , hindering the establishment of the fair competition in the market .
The main reason for the loss is the same as the plight the global steel industry is facing - weak market demand and low capacity utilization rate .
China &apos;s major market mechanisms , economic means and the rule of law approach , the Government &apos;s job is to do a good job of workers and social stability and work to ensure a fair and equitable market order .
The person in charge stressed that the next step , we must continue to do a good job to ensure that we will complete the target task of consumption of the crude steel production capacity of 100 million to 150 million tons .

Moscow city tourist police brigade captain Lei Sakov said that in recent years , Moscow &apos;s urban environment and tourism ambiance has become better and better , with the attractiveness of foreign tourists increasing .

All Moscow tourist police are now proficient in English , and some of them are also good at Spanish and German .

One China News reporter noted that in terms of benefits offered by residence permits , the detailed policies vary from city to city . Compared with the national provisions , more services and convenience are offered in some areas .
There is one benefit added to these areas : if the children meet the relevant requirements , they are allowed to participate in the college entrance examination in their local areas .
In addition , a number of places , including Beijing , also clearly require that the coverage of offering public services and facilities should be gradually expanded and regularly reported to the public .
For example , FuJian Province proposed that at least every three years it will publicly announce the scope of public services and convenience entitled to residence permit holders .

As one of the 2014 first round rookie No. 12 , Salic will officially debut in the NBA next season , and join the Philadelphia 76ers .
Salic as a young European player , many fans are not familiar with him , but through the Olympic Games , I believe that the performance of Salic left a deep impression to the people .
In the last game where Croatian won Spain by a narrow margin , Saric successfully blocked Pau Gasol &apos;s inside shot , with which he attempted to take the game into extra time , down the stretch .
Brett-Brown , the head coach of the 76ers , recently gave Saric a high rating ; the former San Antonio Spurs head coach said Saric reminds him of a young Manu Ginobili .
Obviously , Saric has shown his talent and lets 76ers look forward to him very much .
In the first two games of this Olympic Games , Salic received a total of 24 points , 17 rebounds and 12 assists .
In the first half , Salic showed his ability to search for space on the court . Through pick and roll with his teammates , he made shots outside the arc .
Although the current 76 post players include a lot of talented young players , but they do not have Salic &apos;s abilities as a perimeter player .
From the block to launching a long pass , fast break , and completed assists , in today &apos;s NBA game the number of players who can do all this can be counted on one hand .
Since the beginning of the Olympic Games , Salic has averaged 13 points , eight rebounds and five assists in three games , with an all-around performance .
