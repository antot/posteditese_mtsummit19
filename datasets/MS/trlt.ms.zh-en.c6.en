The 28-year-old chef was found dead at a San Francisco mall
A 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a local shopping mall this week.
But the victim's brother said he could not think of anyone who would want to harm him, saying "everything is finally getting better."
The San Francisco coroner's office said the body found at the Westfield Shopping Center on Wednesday morning was identified as Frank Galicia, a 28-year-old San Francisco resident.
The San Francisco Police Department says the death was ruled a homicide and is under investigation.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC radio station KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who previously worked as a streaming chef in Boston, found an ideal job as a streaming chef at San Francisco's Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
A spokeswoman for the Sons & Daughters restaurant said they were "devastated" by Frank's death.
"We are a small group of people who get along like a close family, and we will miss him very much," the spokesman said.
We extend our deepest sympathy and condolences to Frank's family and friends at this sad time.
Louis Galicia said Frank initially stayed in a guest house, but recently "things are finally getting better."
"Frank found an apartment and was dating a girl at the same time," Louis Galicia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he couldn't think of anyone who would want to hurt his brother.
Frank has a good heart and a big heart.
"Frank often cooks dinner for his family," said Louis Galicia.
He was never willing to quarrel with his family.
He is a man of everyone's opinion.
"Everything in the world can go wrong," says Louis Galicia, "but Frank is something of an outsider who shines every day."
Anyone with information should call the San Francisco Police Department at 415-575-4444.
Junior doctors' strike: call for new industrial action
Junior doctors' representatives have called on the coalition to approve new industrial action over the dispute over the new contract.
The British Medical Association's junior doctors' committee will ask all its members to support more industrial action from the beginning of September.
The junior doctors' committee said ministers had not addressed concerns about the contract.
Junior doctors and medical students voted to boycott a contract deal with the British Medical Association in July.
Fifty-eight percent of the members who took part in the vote opposed the contract deal.
In a letter to members tweeted late on Thursday, junior doctors committee chair Ellen McCourt said the government had been "consistently silent" on the issues that led to the contract boycott.
"In light of this, the junior doctors' committee's executive committee has voted to reject the proposed new contract in its entirety and has called for renewed formal consultation on all concerns," she said.
In response to the government's silence, the junior doctors committee's executive committee has today formally asked the British Medical Association's council to convene a special session to approve a long-term plan aimed at escalating industrial action from early September.
The dispute has led to junior doctors taking part in six strikes this year, including the first all-out strike in NHS history.
Dr Johann Malawana, head of junior doctors at the British Medical Association, resigned following a vote against the agreed terms of the contract recommended by the British Medical Association.
In a meeting before 54,000 junior doctors voted with medical students, he had told members of the British Medical Association that the deal was good and should therefore be accepted.
Following the vote, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the contract would be enforced among England's health care workers.
Russia and Turkey: "Out of the Union"?
A gesture to end a crisis.
Russia and Turkey's leaders met on Tuesday, shaking hands and announcing an official end to an eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
However, when Vladimir Putin greeted the Turkish president in the glittering halls of a St. Petersburg palace, I had a strong feeling that the rapprochement was what Ankara wanted most.
Yes, the two sides did shake hands.
Yet, even by Mr Putin's normally reserved standards, his smile is shallow and almost unenthusiastic.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, for his part, reportedly mentioned "good friend" Putin five times.
I can't remember.
At the same time, he promised that relations with Russia would return to pre-crisis levels, or even higher.
The following day, a newspaper here wrote that Mr. Erdogan acted as if nothing had happened.
But, I think his enthusiasm suggests something to the contrary.
Mr. Putin's continued frosty attitude, however, suggests that he has not forgotten anything.
Indeed, the first thing he mentioned in his opening remarks was the cause of the crisis: Turkey shot down a Russian warplane on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at the time was fierce.
Mr. Putin lashed out at the incident, accusing Ankara of plotting against Moscow behind his back.
Attacks from so-called friends are more difficult to accept.
It is difficult, if not impossible, for the two sides to re-establish real trust.
Russian public opinion has also been turned around since November.
For months, the government-controlled media have carried out a shocking full-throated attack on Ankara.
Suddenly, the Turks seem to be responsible for everything.
The most serious of these were accusations from senior officials: Mr. Erdogan's family profited from illegal oil deals in areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He has categorically denied the claim.
However, news from St Petersburg suggests it is time to move on.
After all, the meeting presupposed that Putin received an apology from Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Russia could declare victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of the truce are obvious.
First, Erdogan was nearly ousted after last month's failed coup, so he needs the support of all his friends.
The incessant terrorist attacks have clearly hit him hard.
There is also a financial incentive.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard, especially by banning charter flights that can transport millions of Russian tourists to Turkey's shores each year.
That number has plummeted by nearly 90 per cent.
Travel agencies and charter companies in Russia are bound to breathe a sigh of relief as flights resume.
They will see a wave of Mediterranean tourism at the end of the season.
State television even predicted this week that the price of fruits and vegetables would fall once Turkey's agricultural imports were liberalized again.
"The tourists go and the tomatoes come back," said a report in the Moscow newspaper Vedemosti.
The visit also has additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is furious at the Western world's feeble response to the takeover's intentions.
Moreover, Ankara has long resented the slow pace of EU accession negotiations and the meddling of Vladimir Putin, who is keen to exploit political chill and weaken Turkey ’ s relations with the Western world.
The Russian leader is bound to get extra points from Ankara for championing the elected authorities after the failed coup.
Note that this is a gift for Moscow, which has always harboured a deep-seated fear of regime change.
So the meeting at the glittering seaside palace has forged an alliance between Russia and Turkey, two countries rejected and abused by the Western world, which one analyst described as an "out of place alliance."
However, despite the public rapprochement, significant differences remain between the two sides.
One of the key factors is Syria, where Moscow has been playing the peacemaker in recent days, while Russia and Turkey have backed opposing factions.
Predictably, after nearly three hours of preliminary talks, the two presidents said at the launch that the topic had not yet been addressed.
The Turkish president has deliberately avoided questions about the differences between the two sides, while Putin has emphasized them.
There is no clear consensus between the two sides on how to seek common ground on the Syrian issue.
With months of open hostility and the possibility of a major catastrophe following the downing of a Russian warplane by Turkey, a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, it is surely good for the leaders of the two countries to resume talks once again.
Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer serve customers outside Scotland
The bank will be reduced to a logistics arm, according to the chief executive of RBS.
Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer serve customers outside of Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the Royal Bank of Scotland brand was committed to its global ambitions.
But that pursuit was abandoned eight years ago when he was on the brink of bankruptcy and had to be bailed out.
During that time, brand strategists used 'RBS' to protect other consumer finance brands.
The group has spent millions of pounds sponsoring international sporting events such as the Rugby Six Nations and Wimbledon tennis champion Andy Murray.
But now, the right thing to do is to get more national brands to make their mark.
RBS will be used by Scottish customers, but will not revert to its original form.
In England and Wales, all references outside the head office and the stock exchange will be changed to National Westminster Bank.
The Ulster Bank brand has been used by customers in the Republic of Ireland and the Autonomous Region of Northern Ireland.
There are other, more prominent, smaller private banking brands, such as Citi, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr. McEwan was interviewed during a visit with customers and employees in Inverness County.
He told BBC Scotland: "The RBS brand will eventually become our investor brand as well as one of the employee hire brands, as we have become a bank with many brands in a larger sense at the moment."
As the bank itself became an international brand, RBS also became a global brand.
For now, I would say that we are no longer focusing on the global, we have turned our eyes to the local.
Each brand represents a difference in their respective industries, and our employees serve our customers through different brands.
RBS has indicated that it will not continue to sponsor the Six Nations Championships; at the same time, it has worked to raise the profile of different brands in sponsoring sporting events.
"It's time to become a multi-brand bank because privately we've been looking at ways to be a better customer service bank," the chief executive said.
We would have been ridiculed if we had aspired three years ago to become a big bank with many brands.
At the moment we are focusing on the needs of our customers and I am sure you are aware of these changes.
I think we can relaunch these brands, and the time is right.
Dettori wins 3,000 career wins with Predilection's success at Newmarket
Newmarket's two victories helped Dayturi to 3,000 career wins before he sprayed champagne to celebrate
Professional jockey Frankie Dettori had his 3,000 win at Newmarket on Friday.
He raced down the track with Predilection, written by trainer John Gosden, to two victories that night and a career-high 3,000.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth professional jockey to reach this milestone in the field.
The top five are: Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
"It's pretty special," said Dai Tully, a three-time champion jockey who won earlier at Ghayyyar.
I was thrilled because my family were there
I'm happy with what I've achieved at Newmarket, because that's where I started 30 years ago.
It's not a massive race or the Royal Ascot, it's just an ordinary Friday night with 20,000 spectators.
I'm relieved and humbled.
The crowd cheered when Dettori brought Predilation after his victory
The achievement was made by two jockeys in the obstacle course, champion jockey Richard Johnson and now retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who has won more than 4,300 in his record-breaking career.
Berger is a nine-time German champion with 4,493 victories in his career
Dettori is one of the best jockeys of his generation, so it's no surprise that he achieved this milestone, not many before him.
He's stylish and robust, but it's his tactical rationality that really makes him stand out in the weighing room.
He is an amazing equestrian ambassador whose enthusiasm and charisma have attracted a large number of fans to the sport over the years.
A few weeks ago, I told Dettori at Epsom that if he had been more than a weekend with a competition jockey, he should have been able to claim 6,000 wins!
Seriously, it's so important that he's Britain's best equestrian winner in three decades.
He has a lively personality, which is good for British horse racing, but beyond that, he's an incredible jockey.
Dettori celebrates this milestone with his signature jump and dismount.
From jumping the line to jumping off the horse, Dettori has been a typical representative of the field of flat racing in Britain for two decades.
His career has been a rollercoaster ride.
He won several tournaments, including the famous "seven wins" at the Royal Ascot in 1996, but he also suffered a plane crash and was banned for taking drugs.
Three years ago, when he returned to the game after a six-month ban, it was a struggle, but he showed amazing character strengths and finally returned to the top, giving skeptics a beating.
He may not be able to do it for too long - Dayturi has said before that he wants to compete until he is at least 50.
Russian President Vladimir Putin removes Sergei Ivanov as chief of staff
Vladimir Putin, Russia's president, unexpectedly sacked Sergei Ivanov as chief of staff to the president.
For years, Mr. Ivanov has been part of a core group that has won Mr. Putin's trust.
Ivanov, 63, has now been appointed special representative for the environment and transport.
A Kremlin statement said Mr. Putin had "announced the dismissal of Ivanov as chief of staff of the Russian president," without giving a reason.
Anton Vaino, who began serving as Mr Ivanov's deputy in 2012, has been appointed as his replacement.
Mr Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital Tallinn, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the embassy in Tokyo.
He later managed the presidential draft and government employees, according to the Kremlin's website (in Russian).
"Thank you for your trust," he told Mr. Putin after his appointment.
I believe that the most important task of this Government is to support the Head of State in the drafting of laws and the implementation of control orders.
Mr. Putin told Russian television on Friday that Mr. Ivanov himself had called for his resignation and recommended Mr. Vaino to take over.
Is this a convincing smile?
Moscow was puzzled by the move.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Putin's closest aides and, like Putin, has worked for the Soviet Security Service (KGB).
As chief of staff, he had been one of the country's most influential figures.
In a meeting with President Vladimir Putin broadcast on state television, both said the chief of staff had called for his resignation.
Despite the smiles on camera, few were convinced - especially at this time before the parliamentary elections.
So is this the result of a defeat in some kind of power struggle?
It is not yet known.
But the official narrative - that a candidate once seen as a presidential candidate suddenly chose to take charge of Russia's environmental policy - has attracted a lot of skepticism.
Quoting Mr. Ivanov's conversation with Mr. Putin on the Kremlin's website, he said: "Yes, in early 2012, I asked you in a conversation to give me this difficult position, or even a troublesome position, for a four-year term."
"As a result, I've been the president's chief of staff for four years and eight months."
Mr. Ivanov assumed the post in December 2011.
Prior to that, he served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Mr. Putin, a former member of the National Security Agency.
When Mr. Putin became head of the Federal Security Service (FSB, formerly the National Security Agency) in the late 1990s, Mr. Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Mr. Putin came to power, he designated Mr. Ivanov as one of his five most trusted people.
Mr Ivanov was once thought likely to become Russia's president after Mr Putin's second term, because a third term would be unconstitutional.
But the job ultimately went to Dmitry Medvedev, Mr Putin's other close aide.
Mr. Putin served as Russia's prime minister until he returned to the presidency in three and a half years.
Mystery Fish Reveals Banff's Garden
A Banff resident called for help after spotting fish in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes the 75 fish were probably sand eels blown by tornadoes in the sea.
Mr Bain, who lives about 500 metres from the sea, posted a video of the bizarre scene on Periscope in the hope that someone would explain to him why the two-inch-long fish appeared.
The Quinsferri Bridge is now accessible to Fife.
The £1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed in May 2017
Engineers have linked the northern deck of the Queensferry Crossing to the viaduct, which means the bridge is now connected to Fife.
The four "bridge fan" arcs near each of the bridge's three bridgeheads are now nearing completion, and the project is the first of its kind.
The bridge, which began in Fife, is 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
It employs 10,000 metric tons of steel, 20,000 metric tons of concrete and 46 cables.
The £1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed in May 2017.
Economy Minister Keith Brown visited the site today, becoming one of the first people to get on the bridge.
"This is a historic moment in the construction of the Quincy Bridge," he said.
We have all witnessed engineering work on such an ambitious project, with more than 30,000 metric tons of concrete and steel used in this section of the bridge alone.
Despite the size and weight of the bridge, completing the connection between the viaduct and the bridge deck requires delicate work and very precise assembly.
Overall, nearly 79 per cent of the total deck has now been installed and the concrete deck of the last section of the bridge was poured in Rosyth today, meaning that all decks are in place.
"Whichever bridge project it is, the first one is a major milestone," said Michael Martin, project director at Quincy Bridge Construction Company.
As far as this remarkable project is concerned, Hailong has demonstrated cutting-edge civil engineering technology.
After installing the final section of the road panel and connecting it to the expanded Northbridge Fort Road panel, the remaining gap closure on the north side or close to the land side needs to be completed.
The completion of this operation will require the relocation of the northern viaduct approach bridge to the south by 700 millimetres.
It was a huge operation and at the same time it was a very sophisticated operation.
It is said to be huge because the viaduct is 222 meters long and weighs about 6,000 metric tons, and needs to be pulled out at an angle of about 3 percent.
It's sophisticated because the engineering team needs to make sure that the deviation is very small, just a few millimetres on each side.
Thankfully, everything is going well.
Simon Byers wins women's gymnastics all-around title
Forget about the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is unaffected by all this.
The vault is full of energy.
the balance beam.
The floor exercise is amazing.
The overall performance was excellent.
Now, finally, an Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast took the all-around title Thursday to fully showcase her talent for leading the world in gymnastics at the Olympic Stadium.
She topped silver medalist Aly Raisman, a member of the Final Five, and bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina of Russia with a combined score of 62.198.
Simon Byers from the United States performs on the balance beam during the artistic gymnastics women's individual all-around final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Byers helped the U.S. team achieve a four-game winning streak in the women's individual all-around gymnastics at the Olympics, where she personally won five medals, further confirming that she is the best gymnast of her generation and probably of all time.
Byers couldn't hold back her tears when she saw her total score. She finally ended the long journey.
Byers thus ranks among the "once-in-a-decade athletes" like Michael Phelps, who take sports to new heights in their respective fields:
"Byers is the best gymnast I've ever seen," said 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton, who has dominated the competition for the last three years, winning 15 World Championship medals, including 10 golds.
There's one final race in Brazil, but it's not so much Byers' rivalry with the other gymnasts as her own battle with the pressure of great expectations.
If Byers hadn't returned to her home in Springs, Texas, loaded with gold medals, everyone would have been very disappointed.
Simon Byers (left), from the United States, hugged Lesman as they won gold and silver in the women's artistic gymnastics individual all-around final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday, August.
Byers won his first gold medal on Tuesday, a surprise gift to retiring national coach Martha Karolyi.
Although Byers insists he has no plans for the future as he takes over the title all year round, it's not quite the case.
A section of Byers' floor exercise - including her iconic somersault - is accompanied by Latin music, which she often listens to in her residence just across the street from Rio's Olympic venues.
This is no coincidence.
The girl, who was adopted as a baby by her grandparents and discovered by coach Amy Boorman's mother during a field trip to the gym, has now grown into a backbone.
Byers hasn't lost an all-around game since the summer of 2013, and she's sure to win if she wants to.
Mustafina's slight lead after two turnovers was an illusion.
Byers, the reigning world champion in both the balance beam and floor exercise events, is waiting in the wings.
She scored 15.433 on the balance beam and 15.933 in the floor exercise.
While waiting for the final score, Leseman gave Byers a gentle hug. Byers burst into tears when he learned that he had achieved his dream.
Leslman's performance was a bit like revenge for four years ago, when she tied for third but lost to Mustafina in the decider.
But this time, the 22-year-old captain, nicknamed "Grandma" by the Americans, was well ahead.
She blew kisses to the crowd after the floor exercise to announce her return, but such a return has sometimes seemed questionable before.
Byers, who is just 19 years old, has been viral on Twitter since earlier this week. For his part, his life has taken on a whole new meaning.
'Several Shot '6-year-old Mahaj Brown survives Philadelphia shooting
A six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, the second six-year-old to be shot in the city this week, police said.
The children's grandparents confirmed to CBS Philadelphia that the child who was shot was Mahaj Brown.
Brown had multiple gunshot wounds to his groin, leg, arm and stomach, they said, but the child was conscious on the way to the hospital.
"He suffered a lot, his tiny body was riddled with bullets," his grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the station.
I couldn't believe it.
The boy is in a critical condition in hospital and has undergone multiple surgeries.
His family told the station that the child was expected to recover.
He was to have started first grade at a local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people who were shot in the Germantown area.
Two of the other three people who were shot were 29 years old and one was 32 years old.
According to CBS Philadelphia, one of the victims, aged 29, is in a critical condition; the other two victims are in stable condition.
The child was found in the front seat of the car with the 29-year-old victim in critical condition, the station said.
Two other victims were not in the vehicle and police are investigating whether the gunman was among those injured.
Investigators told CBS Philadelphia that it looked like multiple gunmen exchanged gunfire.
A number of shell casings of offensive weapons were found at the scene, from which it can be inferred that they were using different offensive weapons.
Judging from this, there is no doubt that this is an ongoing battle.
There were shell casings on the sidewalks on both sides of the street.
"So, this shows that there were a number of armed men on the scene at the time in a state of heavy fighting," Philadelphia Police Chief Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
A number of homes and vehicles were damaged in the area.
No arrests have been made and police are said to be looking at surveillance video.
On Tuesday, another six-year-old, a girl, was playing outside her home in the West Oak Lane neighborhood when she was shot in the arm by a stray bullet.
She is now recovering and police are still hunting for the suspect.
Why do we need Simon and Gabrielle and Laurie?
That's how I rate this year's women's Olympic gymnastics team for more than one reason.
First of all, I've been to every Summer Olympics since 1984, but the United States has never been so dominant.
Second, the team has three elite gymnasts - Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren Laurie Hernandez - who have always inspired many girls of color.
Everyone is proud of the team's composition, which includes Aly Raisman of Judaism and Madison Kocian of the Catholic Church.
The team finally looked like the American team.
It also cemented the pinnacle of black and Latino women in the sport.
The leading female gymnast has been African-American for the past four years.
Last year, Simon and Gabrielle finished in first and second place.
That's awesome.
The United States was cheered at the last Olympics when Gabrielle Douglas "unexpectedly" became an Olympic champion.
Today, the world can witness the superb performance of three-time world champions Simon Byers, Douglas, and Laurie Hernandez, who have taken conventional gymnastics skills to their hearts' content.
On Thursday, Simon helped the U.S. team to a four-game winning streak in the women's individual all-around event.
Her teammate, Ali Leseman, scooped the silver medal.
We have reached the pinnacle of the sport, but not in the national gymnastics classroom.
Simon, Gabrielle and Laurie entered the Olympic team in the same way as Ali and Madison.
They are the "Final Five" because the next Olympic gymnastics team will be made up of four gymnasts, Marta Karolyi's final year in charge.
But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport, with gymnasts training mainly in private gymnastics clubs, their parents paying for training, facilities, travel, clothing, competitions and hotels (including those related to coaches and gymnasts and their families), and the list of costs is constantly growing.
Most of the gymnastics clubs are located in the affluent suburbs that support the industry.
All the gymnasts' training is done at these clubs, which is an expensive long-term expense for the gymnasts' families.
Byers' coach, Aimee Boorman, and Hernandez's coach, Maggie Haney, have coached the two gymnasts since they started gymnastics.
We must bring more affordable and accessible gymnastics training to the millions of young girls who have been influenced by Simon, Gabrielle and Laurie.
Twenty years ago, I set up my own gymnastics foundation.
In my organization, we provided free, inexpensive gymnastics in black neighborhoods to more than 15,000 urban youth, primarily black and Hispanic, and produced national and even world championships.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my home town) to offer high-quality gymnastics to young people who deserve this learning opportunity and will benefit from this remarkable Olympic sport.
Gymnastics contributes to the development of physical strength, flexibility and coordination. It also helps to develop a hard-working spirit, self-discipline and determination.
These can have lifelong benefits for a person's health, academic and professional success.
Inspired by this team, thousands of young girls will learn gymnastics, which is really great.
Participation in sport is significant, particularly for girls.
It's an exciting time.
Thank you to Simon, Ali, Lawrie, Gabrielle and Madison for their "girl power" in winning the Olympic team gold medal, and for inspiring so many young girls of all backgrounds to embark on the path to health, strength and success.
Junior doctors plan to launch further strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposals
Ministers initially wanted to end the dispute over the changes by accepting a revised contract from British Medical Association (BMA) officials, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 junior doctors who took part in the vote opposed the contract.
In July, Mr Hunt revealed plans to force the contract, saying the NHS was in a "vacuum" and that a slight delay would hurt staff and patients.
The new contract begins with a reference to changes to junior doctors' overnight and weekend working practices to improve care during irregular working hours.
Dr Ellen McCourt, chair of the BMA's junior doctors committee, said in a statement last night: "Junior doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, particularly that it will exacerbate the current workforce crisis and fail to treat all doctors fairly."
With just eight weeks to go before the first doctors sign a new contract, we need to make progress and time is running out.
The BMA has tried to resolve disputes through negotiation, but people have been reluctant to participate, and sometimes the government has responded with silence.
That said, just last month we received a commitment from Jeremy Hunt, who said his door was always open.
"Jeremy Hunt needs to take action now to remove enforcement and address junior doctors" concerns.
If he doesn't, junior doctors have made clear they are ready for further industrial action.
The last strike, at the end of April, led to the postponement of almost 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments as nurses and consultant doctors covered for doctors on the picket line.
Ministers initially wanted to end the dispute over the changes by accepting the BMA's revised contract.
The BMA wants to secure better weekend pay for the 54,000 junior doctors covered by the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, chief executive of NHS Employees, has called on junior doctors not to stage any more strikes.
Mr Mortimer said: "Labour action will have little effect, but instead will put pressure on already committed teams and services, causing fear, anxiety and confusion for patients, caregivers and their families."
Over the past two months, we have been in ongoing negotiations with the junior doctors' committee and, together with the Department of Health and others, have responded positively to their concerns about the role of guardians and whistle-blowing.
Employers' desire to continue to actively explore other important topics – such as deployment, flexibility in training, other training for those returning to work after a career break, training costs, a common understanding of the syllabus, further education leave and gender pay differentials in healthcare – illustrates the importance employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health attach to the agreements reached with the BMA in November, February and May.
£2-a-day drug could reduce heart attack threat
Thousands of heart patients will benefit from a £2 a day drug after officials suggest it should be rolled out to more patients and for longer periods of time.
The anticoagulant ticagrelor reduces the risk of heart disease recurrence in patients with heart disease.
The drug is taken continuously for 12 months after a heart attack and can reduce the risk of a stroke or another heart attack.
The NHS watchdog, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), advises patients to take medication for four years in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.
But now NICE, the NHS watchdog, recommends giving patients medication for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.
About 140,000 people in England suffer a heart attack each year, and a quarter of them continue to suffer a heart attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by fatty deposits forming plaques on the walls of the arteries.
If the plaque breaks, it can lead to a blood clot, which in turn can block blood flow to the heart, leading to a heart attack.
If the clot moves, it can enter the bloodstream, blocking blood flow to the brain, leading to a stroke.
Patients who have already experienced a heart attack have a higher risk of another heart attack.
Made by the British company AstraZeneca and sold under the trade name Brilique, ticagrelor reduces the risk of developing disease by reducing the formation of blood clots.
The draft NICE guidance, released today, advises patients to take 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months, and 60 mg of ticagrelor and two aspirin daily for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Centre for Health Technology Assessment, said: "Despite effective secondary prevention treatment, up to one in four people with a history of heart attack will suffer a second attack or stroke, often with serious consequences."
The fear of recurrence can have a significant negative impact on a person's quality of life.
The evidence suggests that taking ticagrelor with aspirin can be effective in reducing the risk of heart attack recurrence and stroke in patients who have experienced a heart attack.
We are deeply relieved that Ticagrelle's interim recommendation will provide many more treatment options for the thousands of people who have benefited.
Given the limited information available on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor after three years, in particular the risk of bleeding, the draft guidance does not recommend its continued use beyond this period.
Computer culture makes' election fraud 'prevalent in Muslim areas
Lutfur Rahman, the former mayor of Tower Hamlets, was sacked last year for corruption, prompting the publication of a government report.
A culture of "political correctness" has turned a blind eye to widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities, the devastating government report reveals today.
Former cabinet minister Sir Eric Pickles has accused the police, election watchdogs and town halls of turning a blind eye to evidence of electoral abuse because they are "overly sensitive to issues of racial division and religion."
The former community secretary, now a top anti-corruption official, said intimidation of voters on religious grounds was a bad influence and police should be allowed to put up cordons outside polling stations to protect alarmed voters.
He advised voters to bring their identity papers with them when they cast their ballots to confirm their identity.
For now, voters simply have to give their name and address.
The report even suggested putting indelible ink on voters' fingers to prevent someone from voting twice.
Sir Eric said protection for whistleblowers should be increased.
He called for increased media access to parliamentary documentation and decisions taken by non-official committees or working groups.
"It's not just about preventing election fraud, it's about protecting local governments from a widespread culture of corruption and the financial scams that are closely linked to it," he said.
The report was requested by Downing Street in the wake of the Tower Hamlets election scandal in East London.
Last year, a special electoral tribunal ruled that incumbent Mayor Rahman was guilty of a string of corruption and wrongdoing and should be removed from office.
The court found that Rahman had "very ridiculously abused" the religious sentiments of the Muslim community and kept quiet about the charge that the sword had accused him of racial discrimination and Islamophobia.
Rahman is said to have "declared on the campaign trail that it is a religious duty of faithful Muslims to vote for him."
As many as 300 ballots are in doubt and may have been cast by voters impersonating someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of electoral fraud across the country.
In particular, he warned of electoral fraud by mail, where senior members of the Muslim community were said to have put pressure on voters to vote for their chosen candidate.
Sir Eric (pictured) gave a number of suggestions for cleaning up the voting mechanism, including bringing identification papers to confirm his identity
"Evidence suggests that senior members, particularly in Pakistani and Bangladeshi background communities, are putting pressure on vulnerable groups in some minority communities, particularly women and young people, to vote as they wish," he said in the report.
"Being overly sensitive to racial profiling and religious' political correctness', they fear that state institutions will turn a blind eye to such behavior."
Sir Eric has made 50 proposals to clean up the electoral mechanism, including barring political activists from processing mailed ballot papers to prevent "vote harvesting."
The report, which also calls for rigorous checks on registration information to prevent the electoral roll being used for immigration and welfare scams, is also being considered by Theresa May.
The proposals include requiring voters to show identification before they cast their ballots.
Smear indelible ink on voters' fingers after the vote to prevent someone from casting a second ballot.
Systematically verify the ethnic affiliation of voters to ensure eligibility to vote.
Set the validity period for automatic mail voting requests at three years.
Politicians and activists are prohibited from processing completed postal ballots and postal ballot envelopes.
The police are authorized to set up a cordon around the polling station.
The legislative provisions were amended to make it easier to bring charges of intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
It is illegal to take photographs at polling stations.
It is stipulated that only English may be used at polling stations (with the exception of the Welsh region).
Strengthen training to ensure that staff strictly enforce the rule that "voters go to the voting hall alone."
Sir Eric lashed out at the Metropolitan Police, saying it was' astonishing 'that they had not made any criminal charges following the incident in Tower Hamlets.
"Rahman and his electoral officers were disqualified by the Electoral Tribunal because of a number of corrupt and illegal practices," he said.
According to the criminal standard of proof, he is unquestionably guilty in many respects.
He also lashed out at the defunct "tick check" of the City Hall election registration department.
Sir Eric said: "Last year's court decision on Tower Hamlets was a wake-up call for everyone."
Our country has a proud tradition of being the "mother of parliaments," but the secretive electoral fraud and subsequent denial by certain institutions is worrying and threatens this good reputation.
Cyclists who look like Princess Kate and bump into other celebrities at the Rio Olympics are in hot demand
Pauline Ferrand Prevot, the French cyclist who looks exactly like Princess Kate at the 2016 Rio Olympics, has been courted by viewers this week.
But the 24-year-old Olympian isn't the only gold-medal contender to hit a celebrity face at this summer's Olympics, at least not on social media.
So, in honor of the Rio Olympics and all the celebrity faces that appeared on screen at the time, FEMAIL has put together a list of Olympians who have hit Hollywood stars.
Hunter and Wolf: American men's archer Brady Ellison (left) has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since childhood
In addition to the cyclist who bumped into Kate on the track, many Internet users quickly discovered that an archer was the twin brother of Leonardo DiCaprio.
Brady Ellison, an American male archer, has caused a huge stir on social media since pictures of him posing as the star of the Wolf of Wall Street emerged on Twitter.
In fact, the archer sensed the hype on social media and admitted that when he was young, some people said he looked like a plum.
"I don't think I look much alike, except for the beard," Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking dude, so I think that's a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons at the 2012 London Olympics will no doubt find more similarities this year: Great Britain's long jumper Greg Rutherford looks exactly like the famous actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Aliya Mustafina, a Russian gymnast with big talking eyes, has been accused of looking like Gloria Estefan, a Cuban-American singer.
And in swimming, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to "Glee" star Matthew Morrison for years.
Dress up: The user believes Nathan Adrian is a 'sporty version' of the Inception actor
Another pair that is often compared are tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who have thick eyebrows and lips that resemble each other.
Silver medal-winning Russian swimmer Yulia Efimova and actor Annalynne McCord have the same bronzed skin and blonde hair, while Team USA's Ni Jiajun has been compared by fans to the 'sporty Joseph Gorgon Levitt'.
FEMALE MAN: Soccer star Hope Solo (left) and Dexter actor Jennifer Carpenter (right) have similar faces and eyes
Not the only one: One Twitter user was happy to find that others saw the similarities as well
Communication theory: According to this user, the pair may look alike for a reason
One Twitter user recently happily declared online that "other netizens agree that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter actually look exactly alike."
Indeed, the American football star and the Bloodthirsty Forensics star have remarkably similar faces and eyes.
Other popular comparisons include Kerri Walsh Jennings, who has a smile almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney, and gymnast Gabby Douglas, who won the gold medal, who has a beautiful and radiant smile similar to that of Bringing It On star Gabrielle Union.
CBC Olympics commentator apologises for Chinese swimmer's' slow as a pig 'comment
Byron MacDonald's comments Wednesday about 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth-place finish in the women's 4x200m freestyle relay infuriated viewers who watched the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's live Olympic broadcast
CBC was forced to apologise after a commentator for the Canadian broadcaster CBC said the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "started off faster than the stench" and ended up "as slow as a pig."
Commentator Byron McDonnell made some comments at the end of the women's 4x200m freestyle relay final when he thought his microphone had been turned off.
"The 14-year-old Chinese girl made a stupid mistake," said Byron, who was a "tinted" commentator on the CBC's team of commentators.
Being so excited, he started to swim faster than the stench, but then he was as slow as a pig.
Thanks to her.
Ai Yan, a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer, finished second in 1: 57.79 - 1.61 seconds behind Canada's Taylor Ruck, which helped the Canadian team close the gap with China.
Viewers across Canada were taken aback by the narrator's tone and phrasing, and they were quick to react online
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: "The CBC commentator said China's 14-year-old swimmer was' slow as a pig '??"
The idiot didn't realise it was live.
"That 14-year-old Chinese girl made a stupid mistake," said Ai Yanhan, a Chinese teenager who competed in the final of the women's 4x200m freestyle relay.
Twitter's criticism of Byron McDonnell quickly spread across the tweets, with many calling for it to drop out of the commentary.
When Twitter users heard that Byron McDonnell was slow to respond, they didn't stop there.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: 'Wow # Byron MacDonald.
You're representing CBC and Canada, and your words and actions make us all sound like a bunch of racists. # That's disgusting.
Shortly afterwards, CBC radio host Scott Russel apologised on air for Byron's comments, saying: "We apologise for the comments we made about the performance of the live swimmers."
"We're sorry for the inappropriate language."
CBC apologized more than 90 times to those Twitter users who responded to the comment
Another commentator, Scott Russel, also apologized on behalf of Byron
CBC later copied and pasted their apology to more than 90 other Twitter users protesting Byron's comments
The channel also quickly apologized and released a statement.
We are extremely sorry to say this and broadcast it live.
Last night, we moved quickly to apologise to viewers who tuned in to watch us live, as well as those who followed us on social media.
It should be noted that Byron's commentary was aimed at the swimmer's performance, but not at her personally.
That said, the wording was really inappropriate, and Byron was deeply sorry about that.
On Thursday afternoon, McDonnell apologized during a live broadcast, saying there was nothing personal about his words and attempting to use them to excuse his remarks.
"I want to take a moment to apologize for the comments I made last night after the women's relay race," he said on the CBC Olympics broadcast.
"I'm just commenting on the swimmer's performance, not the individual."
"Of course, I didn't mean to be disrespectful, I'm sorry."
Primark customers have expressed outrage at a woman who brazenly tried on her underwear in the middle of the store
A woman takes off her underwear on the spot in the middle of a Primark store where customers don't know where to look.
To make matters worse, she also looked at how she looked when she put it on, before taking her underwear off and putting it back on the shelf.
She continued to browse the shelves and eventually tried on four pairs of underwear inside the store at the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone.
The woman kept trying on her underwear inside the Primark store at the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone before putting it back on the shelves
Jenny Davidson, a mother of two who was also at the store at the time, said that after trying on her underwear, the mystery woman "got dressed again and walked out of the store without buying anything."
"People couldn't believe what they were seeing," she said.
She just stood in the middle of the store, took a pair of panties off the shelf, took off her tights and underwear, and put them on.
"She didn't try to find a secluded place to try it on - she just stood there, it was cheeky."
"Everyone was stunned when she took her underwear off again. Obviously, she was still not satisfied because she put it back on the shelf."
After that, she tried three more like this, only to find that none of them were her favorite, then dressed again and walked out of the store.
"She didn't seem to care that someone was looking at her - or wondering who would end up buying the underwear she was trying on."
Ms Davidson (33), who lives in Kent, said: "It's disgusting to think that someone will buy someone else's underwear that hasn't been cleaned."
The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms Davidson added: "When she left, the shop assistant obviously had to take the underwear off the shelves, but fortunately that was the case."
"I hate to go home and buy a new pair of underwear, only to find another woman trying them on and not being cleaned."
A spokesman for Primark said: "Primark has been made aware of what happened inside our Folkestone store on Tuesday, August 9."
All the items in question have been removed from the shelves.
How to Protect Yourself with Gamma in a Gun Attack
The world is a dangerous place, but this video on Dailymail.com may give you a sense of security.
We asked Rhon Mizrachi, a master of the Krav Maga Federation in New York, for advice on how to deal with gun-toting assailants at close range.
Whether he's approaching you from the front or the back, the video will teach you how to turn defeat into victory.
If the gunman approaches you from behind, the first thing you have to do is turn around so you can see the attacker and "clear the line of fire," Mizrachi said.
Then, hold the gun between your forearms and shoulders, and then hit the attacker in the face with your elbow.
Next he put his knee to his groin and, as the attacker bent over in pain, turned the gun in his hand and hit him in the face with the barrel and reserve gun, keeping the weapon pointed at him.
If the gunman approaches from the front, use a similar technique - keep your body out of the line of fire, seize the gun and reverse the muzzle so that the gunman can't fire.
At the same time, weight was placed on the gun and the attacker was hit in the chest and the muzzle was twisted from his clenched hands before being pointed at him.
Sounds complicated?
Check out the video to see exactly how Mizrachi does it.
But remember, if you're not a maestro, the safest way to get rid of a robbery is to hand over the cash.
A rogue family destroys low-rent housing in Saltash, Cornwall, before being evicted
A rogue family evicted for intimidating neighbours caused £50,000 in damage to their low-rent accommodation before leaving.
Tanya Skeldon and her husband Shaun Trebilcock were evicted from their low-rent house in Soltash, Cornwall, after a long list of complaints.
After being forcibly removed from the residence, housing association officials were surprised to find that it had been severely damaged.
There were holes all over the walls, the floor was ripped, garbage was thrown all over the floor, and the walls were covered in a mess.
The family has been moving since being evicted and is said to be currently living in a private home
Donna McEvoy, housing manager for the Cornwall Housing Association, said she was concerned the house was beyond saving.
"It's a nightmare for the people who live here, and I don't think people can live like that," she said.
There are a lot of things to weigh in now because the house is likely to be a bad element in Cornwall.
The family is notorious, and their names are equally notorious.
The couple, who have three sons, will live here from time to time.Police said the family's terror included using baseball bats to fight in the streets, terrorising nearby residents, taking drugs, drug trafficking, shouting, arguing and swearing.
The 47-year-old tenant, Skeldon, received an anti-social behaviour resolution in June.
Many of the rooms in the house, which is likely to be demolished, are long standing rubbish
The floor was lifted in the room where the drugs had been sold
Neighbours claimed they were often seen fighting in the streets and often called police over the incident
The Cornwall Housing Society this week forcibly removed her from the residence with her husband after giving them an 11-week extension to move voluntarily.
Neighbours who were finally relieved cheered, saying that life had been a living hell.
"They don't care about anyone," said one neighbour.
We've been living next door to them for 20 years and it's been so bad.
We've seen the police at the door countless times.
"This morning we couldn't sleep.
We get up early because it's so quiet here - we're not used to it yet!
It's great that they're finally gone.
Adam Fitzpatrick, community executive manager of the Cornwall Housing Association, said the family had failed to cooperate with the local government.
The family has lived in the house for 20 years and is regularly visited by police
Garbage and old toys were thrown on the overgrown side of the tenement
He added: "It is regrettable that the tenant did not take any responsibility for her behaviour with her family and the eviction was the last thing the Cornwall Housing Association considered."
It was a very difficult case to deal with because their behaviour was so extreme and what they were doing must have been extremely frightening for the neighbours.
I thank my team for their work, as well as Devon and Cornwall Police and members of the community who have been brave enough to provide us with information.
I hope this will provide some comfort to our neighbours and send a message that we will not tolerate anti-social behaviour.
Mr Fitzpatrick said their three sons had lived in the house at various times, but said they were all in their 20s.
A dirty mattress was also thrown on the floor of one of the bedrooms after they were removed
Housing association workers will soon be clearing piles of rubbish around the house
In 2014, police had searched the house and found 70 grams of marijuana, as well as scales, drug paraphernalia and £1,700 in cash.
After pleading guilty, Skeldon was fined for possession of Class B drugs and trafficking in drugs with intent.
She claimed the money was used to buy a tombstone for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car crash in 2013.
It is understood Tanya and her husband now live in a private house in Plymouth after becoming homeless.
The walls of many of the rooms in the house were covered with graffiti.
Police said they would evict tenants who defied the tenants' rules.
Angela Crow, of Devon and Cornwall Police, said the eviction issued a clear warning to other tenants who continued to defy tenant rules.
"This warning is for people who don't think they're going to be blamed for their actions, and for people who have been devastated by it," she said.
Devon and Cornwall Police do not tolerate crime and anti-social behaviour and will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Reid: Hillary Clinton, if elected president, would nominate Garland to the Supreme Court
Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid said he is confident that if Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton is elected president, she will nominate Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court.
Senate Republicans have blocked the confirmation of Garland since President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the next president would choose him to replace the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
Reid said on a conference call Thursday that he predicted Hillary would pick Garland who "has some credibility."
A spokeswoman for Reid later said Reid had not spoken directly to Hillary about whether she would nominate Garland, and said he was only guessing.
He heaped praise on Garland and said Hillary's team didn't want to be "spoiled" by the new pick.
Garland is the chief justice of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in the District of Columbia.
The Republicans who blocked Garland's nomination are "favorites" and "achievers" of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, Reid said.
He said Trump was unfit to be president.
"Treats": Nude calendar "Favorite for both men and women"
Treats Magazine will be working with photographer David Bellemere on a 2017 calendar inspired by Pirelli in the 1970s.
This time, they plan to look for a new generation of top models for their 2017 NU Muses calendar, rather than the famous nude.
Treats president Steve Shaw said earlier this year that their mostly nude magazine was different from the old-school Playboy because "the latter is for men."
And we're targeting women.
Obviously, he thinks the same is true of this set of calendars.
"We need to show timeless and classic nudity that makes both women and men feel comfortable, and this time it's inspired by that," Shaw said at a calendar launch.
Women will be happy to take part in the shoot because it's a beautiful work of art.
Models can submit photo applications online or in person at public recruitment sites in Los Angeles and New York.
Small-headed sleeping shark is the longest-living vertebrate, video report shows
Scientists say the Greenland shark is the longest-living vertebrate on Earth.
Julius Nielsen, who has been studying sharks, said it has been documented that a female calf shark is estimated to be between 272 and 512 years old and up to five metres long.
French court rejects petition to demolish shops in Jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected a petition by the Calais government to demolish dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in the "Jungle" refugee camp, where thousands of refugees are currently living.
At a court hearing this week, the Calais government argued that the French government should have the power to dismantle a total of 72 makeshift shops in the camp, where people sell everything from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts and sell tea for 50 cents (40p) or basic meals for a few euros in makeshift restaurants.
The Office of the Governor of Calais believes that these places should be demolished because they are a parallel economy that does not pay taxes, and there are fire and health hazards.
Humanitarian groups, however, told the Court that the shops and restaurants were extremely important because the free food provided by State-sponsored associations and other groups simply did not meet the needs of the growing number of refugees in the camp.
They claim the makeshift shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food for those in need.
A court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis to evict the operators of the 72 temporary stores, but said the governor of Calais's concerns were "perfectly understandable."
Judge Jean François Molla said the role of the grocers, cafes and restaurants went far beyond simply providing food to refugees who were "living in extremely dangerous conditions."
These places, he said, were a peaceful meeting point between refugees and volunteers.
One of the sites threatened with demolition is the camp's "Jungle Book Kids" cafe, which provides 200 meals a day, English and French lessons, as well as shelter advice for hundreds of unaccompanied vulnerable minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people signed a petition to protect the café.
A letter to the Guardian wrote that closing the cafe "would be a major disaster for these children, many of whom are as young as eight."
The charity Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants on Friday predicted the number of refugees in the Jungle camp had topped 9,000, the highest level since the summer surge.
Great Britain won the silver medal in the sevens rugby match and Fiji won the gold medal
The British team failed to extend their previous outstanding performance in front of Fiji in Thursday night's sevens rugby final, which was beaten 43-7 by Fiji at Riyotiodoro Stadium.
Fiji won gold with an unassailable performance in possession, steals, avoidance, coordination, running and strength, the country's first ever Olympic medal.
The silver medal was also a small consolation to the defeated British team, which won its third silver medal of the day, a feat that was enough to make the British rugby team proud: they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa all the way to their first rugby sevens tournament at the Olympics.
Earlier in the day, the British team narrowly beat South Africa 7-5, which may have affected their form in the final.
But in any case, the current Fijian team is good enough to beat a spirited 15-a-side team.
Tomorrow, at least one Briton will wear a gold medal, which may or may not be a consolation to the British team, namely Wimbledon's Fiji coach Ben Ryan, who was head coach of the British team.
It wasn't easy for the British team to get where they are today.
Eight years ago, under Ryan's tutelage, they were undefeated at the Adelaide International Sevens Rugby Tournament.
And now, they're just one step away from the title.
While they have been hit hard, they have made remarkable progress.
Fiji dominated the opening session, leaving the British team defenceless.
For Tom Mitchell and his teammates, it was like crashing into a string of moving buss.By the time Ossie Colliniseau slammed into the corner flag zone, the World Series champions were well ahead 5-0.
Just four minutes into the game, Jerry Toowey scored another touchdown on the right wing.
At 12-0, the British team had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's powerful interception kept the Giants' Lyon Nakalava from scoring a third time, but that only slowed Fiji's scoring.
Yassa Willemaru touched down in the right corner on seven minutes. 17-0, to add insult to injury for the British team.
Carrava scored another point with one minute left in the first half of the match.
Then Watmore LaVovo broke through the English defence and went straight to the scoring line.
By halftime, the score was already 29-0.
The Fijians seem to have been born to play rugby sevens, while the British team is still in its infancy.
That's the way it is.
Great Britain made a huge change in the second half and stormed the Fijians' defence for a full four minutes, which was fine in the first half, but then the Fijian team played well and scored again with Joshua Tuesova.
Dan Norton created a scoring opportunity for the British team by touching the ground in the left corner and changing the score to 36-7, but the game was already in the hands of the South China Sea island nation, whose fans were singing loudly, waving flags and singing and dancing on the platform.
The wonderful performance of the Fiji team had to be applauded.
Mata William stopped an indifferent Fiji attack in the final minute.
The final whistle sounded, the Fijians hugged each other, while the defeated British team could only regret leaving the game.
Earlier in the day, Fiji beat Japan 20-5 in the semifinals, while Britain edged South Africa in a close semi-final clash.
Kyle Brown helped South Africa take the lead in the first half, but Dan Norton scored in the second half with excellent footwork.
After that, England's Anthony's brother Marcus Watson secured the team's victory with a brilliant interception that ended with the British team winning the silver medal.
Helen Graf and Heather Stanning were inspired by their cancer-stricken coach to win rowing gold
It's no exaggeration to say that this is the most moving piece of gold medal.
Helen Graff and Heather Stanning have trained 220 times since their first paddle, and the gold medal they won at Estacio da Lagoa is even more remarkable.
Although they were the only two to paddle, the voice of one other person on board - coach Robin Williams - had been with them as they hit their second straight Olympic gold medal in the women's double sculls, the first British combination of rowing women to reach that height.
They have maintained an unbeaten record of 39 matches and have an absolute advantage.
What we're seeing is these two talented athletes moving gracefully on the water, but that's not the whole story of this victory.
There are many volunteers behind every rowing gold medal, and it is their constant dedication that makes a difference, and none more so than a coach who learned 30 months ago that he had cancer and didn't know if he would live to see the day.
As he said, death could come at any moment.
I had bladder cancer and they operated on me.
Without surgery, the cancer will spread throughout the body.
That way, the situation would be much worse.
This will change your mind a little bit.
Williams was diagnosed with cancer in December 2013.
Fortunately, he began treatment in early 2014 to minimize the impact, although that might not be appropriate in the circumstances.
I need to get paid, so I've got to get better soon.
It was an inspiration for me.
I was in the hospital, and although they said a few steps would be enough, I walked around the ward 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time.
This is where it all started.
Rowing is a journey in itself, and that makes the journey a little bit longer.
The first thing on their minds at the moment they won gold was Williams, who was slightly more talkative than usual this morning in an attempt to overcome his anxiety.
"I'm in a bad mood this week, maybe a little extreme, but this gold medal is really something," said Stanning, a former captain of the Royal Artillery Regiment, who will travel to Afghanistan.
It told me over and over again how much it meant to me and how hard I, Helen and Robin worked.
It's a reward for three years of hard work by Helen, Robin and me.
Without Robin, we're still just nobody, thank you very much, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have found better trainers and coaches than him.
Helen Graff and Heather Stanning were unbeaten in five years.
The pair set penalties that their opponents could not match.
Even in the final 500 metres, when New Zealand and Denmark began closing in, Stanning and Graf still had plenty of physical reserves.
It was really scary at the time.
Helen called: "Keep up the pace, keep up the pace."
It's really important not to be influenced by your opponents.
We're off to a great start and we're not looking forward to doing anything earth-shattering.
We didn't think about the glory today, we just wanted to paddle every paddle and win this race, and we did.
It took the pair a year to decide their future.
Graff will marry TV adventurer Steve Bachchard next month.
Now, though, she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I don't want to say this is my last game.
It would put too much pressure on me.
In London, it took me about six months to realise I was an Olympic champion.
It was a completely new experience, and I felt very nervous.
About four minutes have passed.
"I'm feeling much better," she said.

Bulgaria's inflation for first time in eight months
National statistics show that the monthly inflation rate in Bulgaria was 1 per cent in July.
This is the highest rate of inflation in several years (since June 2012), which broke above zero for the first time since October last year (0.2 per cent).
The average annual inflation rate (as measured by the consumer price index) over the past 12 months (August 2014 to July 2015) was -0.8% compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 to July 2015).
The consumer price index for July 2016 was 101.0 per cent compared to June 2016, representing a monthly inflation rate of 1.0 per cent.
The inflation rate so far this year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) is -0.2%, compared to July 2015, when the annual rate was -0.2%.
Prices of the following categories of consumer goods increased in July 2016 compared to the previous month: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7 per cent), transport (1.8 per cent), entertainment and culture (6.3 per cent), restaurants and hotels (1.2 per cent) and other goods and services (0.3 per cent).
Declining prices were recorded for clothing and footwear (2.2 per cent), furniture, appliances and routine maintenance (0.5 per cent) and medical care (0.1 per cent).
At the same price as last month were alcoholic drinks and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications, education.
Snapchat's' anime 'effect accused of being sarcastic about Asians
Snapchat said the filter was inspired by anime, but some observers thought it had racial overtones.
Snapchat's 150 million everyday users can use its filter tools to change reality and make people look ridiculous.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a character in a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
These lenses have the effect of passivating, bending features, producing more than 30 million retouched selfies every day.
Any mistakes will be noticed by the public immediately.
Snapchat lenses have been criticized, and the app has been accused of encouraging the play of black people or the beauty of white skin.
So when the app this week offered some users a filter that could create squint, grotesque teeth and pink face effects, some critics called it a racial satire on Asia's "yellow race."
They even wonder whether these recurring problems mean the company has bigger problems with diversity.
Wednesday's report by The Verge and Motherboard sparked outrage after Snapchat said it had removed the feature.
The company's explanation: The filter is a tribute to the anime characters, not a satire of Asians.
But for observers who have experienced racism, the filter reminds them of the damaging stereotypes of reality.
Others are also adamantly opposed to these animated images.
A Korean-American art student, who tweeted about the photos and was widely shared, said in an email that the filters were "at least uncomfortable and uncomfortable."
"It's hard to tell the difference between an extremely disgusting Asian satirical image and the effect of the filter," she added.
While it's not just the yellow in the filter, the yellow is extremely devalued.
Snapchat isn't the only company that has touched the bottom line of these cultures.
From corporate boards to Hollywood and the devices we carry, American culture seems to have been promoting diversity and inclusion.
Snapchat's large group of young people can be sensitive because they are more ethnically diverse than older generations.
When one of Snapchat's filters produced an insulting image for users, Zhu Katie, 25, said in an interview on Thursday: "It's harder than ever to escape the spotlight."
On Thursday, Ms. Zhu, a product manager and engineer at Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and encourage others to do the same.
In an article for Medium and a telephone interview, she said she believes the racial controversy reflects Snapchat's lack of racial diversity in the hiring process.
Ms. Chu criticized the company's mostly white employees, its all-male leadership, and added a tag at the end of the article: # DeleteSnapchat.
"Either they don't have people of all colors on their staff to make that decision, or they have people of color on their staff, but their position doesn't allow them to speak out," says Ms. Zhu, a Chinese-American.
Other observers shared complaints that she had not received a response from Snapchat.
The company does not release data on employee diversity and says it is a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the racial background of its employees, but a spokesman said the company recently hired a recruiter to focus exclusively on the underrepresented internally and to promote internal inclusiveness.
Ms Zhu said she would close her Snapchat account: "I wonder if they need more users like us who are against this."
Congressional panel says military officials distorted ISIS intelligence
In a report released Thursday, a congressional panel noted that officials at U.S. Central Command changed intelligence reports to describe the war against ISIS in Iraq and Syria as more optimistic than it actually was.
The interim report, from a special working group formed by the Republican chairmen of the House Armed Services Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the House Appropriations Committee's defense subcommittee, said there was "widespread dissatisfaction" among Central Command intelligence analysts who said their superiors were tampering with their assessment of the US war against Islamic State.
Central Command (Centcom) in Tampa, Florida, is the military headquarters that oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
According to a news release on the report, "Intelligence vetted by senior leadership at Central Command presents a more optimistic picture of U.S. counterterrorism operations than is actually the case, and is consistently more optimistic than other intelligence agencies' analysis."
"The actions of Central Command are unacceptable," said a Republican representative in California. "On the one hand, our fighters are suffering from the war, and on the other hand, senior policymakers are receiving the wrong analysis."
The question of the leadership of the Central Command has extended to the highest levels of the institution.
The report detailed long-standing problems at Central Command in 2014 and 2015 in describing and analyzing U.S. training of Iraqi forces.
While there is no conclusive evidence that senior officials in the Obama administration ordered changes to the reports, the analysts, according to their descriptions, felt pressured by central command leaders to express more optimistic views about the threat from Islamic State (ISIS or ISIL).
"In the first half of 2015, many of the Central Command press releases, statements and congressional testimony were much more optimistic than they actually were," the report said.
For example, a Central Command official has publicly stated that a major military operation to retake Mosul could take place as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, is still under IS control.
"After months of investigation, the results have been very clear," Mike Pompeo, a Kansas Republican representative, said in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, most of the top intelligence officials at U.S. Central Command manipulated the command's intelligence products, hiding the threat from ISIS in Iraq.
The Republican Party set up a task force after learning from analysts that intelligence about ISIS was being manipulated.
More findings will follow this report, released on Thursday, as the investigation continues.
The Attorney General of the Ministry of Defence has also conducted a lengthy investigation into the Central Command.
Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee released their findings on Thursday, in line with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.
"Between 2014 and 2015, Central Command developed an overly narrow process for intelligence assessments of Islamic State and Iraqi peacekeeping forces," Xie Anda, a representative of the committee's Democratic leadership, said in a statement.
Mr Sheanda said the process "interfered with the release of intelligence", demoralised analysts and "could not accept different opinions."
But Mr. Sheanda and the Democrats also said they had found no evidence that the White House was trying to put pressure on analysts at Central Command, so that their conclusions were consistent with "preconceived or political narratives."
The Beast Daily News reported the preliminary results of the congressional investigation on Tuesday.
Last August, the New York Times reported that the Pentagon Attorney General opened an investigation after receiving complaints from analysts at Central Command.
Pentagon spokesman Navy Major Patrick Evans said in a statement that the Defense Department would not comment on the congressional report until the attorney general's investigation is complete.
But he said: "Experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex data, while intelligence agencies and the Department of Defense encourage healthy dialogue on these important national security themes."
The impact of this investigation has outweighed the question of whether the U.S.-led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria has succeeded, as more and more Defense Department officials claim.
But last year, the claims raised questions about the extent to which President Obama could trust the assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas issued by Central Command.
Criticism of ISIS intelligence is reminiscent of the controversy more than a decade ago, when Central Command intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker wrote a research article stating that George Bush's administration, despite the objections of many analysts, insisted on sending small forces to Iraq and gave little thought to the aftermath of the 2003 invasion.
Mr. Hooker played a key role in the campaign against Islamic State intelligence.
Last year, officials said Mr. Hooker's team came to the conclusion that airstrikes targeting Islamic State refineries had not significantly cut the economic revenue of the terrorist group, which has built temporary refineries to continue selling oil on the black market, a far cry from the published statement.
Central Command did not release the findings to the public, according to a September report in Time magazine.
Central Command Commander Lloyd Austin III came under fire last year after several lawyers reviewed Senate testimony about an overly optimistic assessment of the war.
General Austin retired in April and is currently being replaced by Joseph Votel in his position at Central Command.
The United States won four straight in women's hockey and will go head-to-head with Great Britain
Katie Bam, who scored three points in the 6-1 win over Japan, led the U.S. women's hockey team in a 3-0 victory over India on Thursday.
Five goals in two games is a shock, but the 27-year-old says she didn't know she was doing so well.
"I don't know anything about that," she said.
I'm not the type of person who remembers how many goals I've scored.
What she knows is that the United States has won four straight games at the Olympics and will be competing for first place in the group with the British team that won 2-0 against Japan on Thursday.
Britain and the United States met on Saturday in the final game of the first round.
Both teams advanced to the quarter-finals, a match that will determine who comes in at the top of the group.
The team that finished first in the group will be able to go further by avoiding the mighty Dutch, who came out first in the other group.
The United States performed miraculously on Saturday, finishing bottom of the 12 teams at the London Games four years ago.
Bam was also on that team at the time.
Bam, who grew up in Breubel, Pa., picked up a hockey stick for the first time at age 3 (her twin sister played the sport in Drexel) and joined the national team at the age of 16, becoming the youngest member of the national team to date.
She missed the 2008 Olympics because she failed to make the final list.
In 2012, she and her teammates were viewed unfavorably.
The following year, the Englishman Craig Panham took over as head coach and everything started to change.
"It's a change of culture, mentality and substance," Mr Bam said.
We weren't at our current level in London.
We had a complete turnaround.
On Thursday night, Bam took the lead with a close-range backhand shot in the first half.
India's were unbeaten in the tournament, but the team showed amazing tenacity and held on to a 1-0 run towards the end of the third quarter when Bam exploded.
She took the ball on a long run down the left side of the court, then cut inside to the middle and volleyed into the net, giving the United States a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez scored the final goal in the middle of the fourth quarter.
The United States versus goalkeeper Jackie Briggs, who was unbeaten for the first time in the tournament, scored one goal in each of their first three victories.
This time she's out of the ordinary.
Bam, too.
"We're in good shape," Mr Parnham said, but just how good will depend on the outcome of Saturday's game.
Cheap food from the Great Depression in The Great Dinner
In March 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who had just been elected president, sat down to lunch in the president's office.
As a gourmet, President Roosevelt enjoyed Fifth Avenue delicacies such as foie gras and Maryland stewed fish.
That day, his menu was simple: ketchup devil's eggs, mashed potatoes and preserved fruit pudding for dessert.
"It's about sharing food with people who are suffering," said Jane Siegman.
"It also reflects the way Americans eat and drink," added her husband, Andrew Coe.
The couple, who live in Brooklyn Heights, are both food historians.
Mr. Coe's last book, "Chowder," was about Chinese food in the United States, and Ms. Zigman, in her book "97 Orchard," told the story of the lives of slum dwellers through food.
Their new book, "The Great Dinner," which will be published Tuesday by Harper Press, is about the history of food in the United States during the Great Depression.
After showing some common food insights, they meet a reporter at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a simple lunch counter in the ironing district that has been open since the economic crash of 1929.
Ms. Siegman, 54, ordered a cream cheese with a chopped olive sandwich, while Mr. Coe, 57, ordered a turkey, mashed potatoes and a vegetable platter.
The reporter ordered a meatloaf, which the couple thought was appropriate for discussing the Great Depression diet.
"Bread was very popular at the time," Ms. Sigman said.
There was peanut bread, liver bread and soybean bread.
They are made from a single ingredient and a cheap topping that can be poured over the ingredients.
Imagine your dinner is full of peanuts.
Mr. Coe made a strange appearance.
"They're definitely like lead in your stomach," he said.
In the years before the Great Depression, Americans ate buffets, especially in the suburbs.
A group of women cooked meals for the male farm workers, with freshly baked pies for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
During World War I, it was the Americans who gave food to hungry Europeans. "The Feast" chronicles how the country suddenly ceased to be a land of plenty.
Mr Coe explains why he and his wife wrote the book: "At the time, food had become a major source of irritation for Americans."
Another unpleasant topic is the shabby new food: "Enchanted foods" such as bread and stews have become the main course, and stews are "the best way to cook leftovers," Ms. Siegman said, because chefs can use the butter in sauces to mask the unpalatable ingredients.
Fresh fruit is replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, which has dominated the American dinner table for years, has become a rare luxury.
Strange hodgepodge is all about calories, and nutrition comes first, rather than taste or even basic culinary knowledge.
In the course of researching the book, including various recipes, Ms. Zigman made a roasted onion stuffed with peanut oil.
"It's not common at the dinner table," Mr. Ko said.
Ms Sigman said: "It's also so weird."
Peanut oil doesn't go well with roasted onions.
This is a feature of many family meals.
Family economists influence the country's eating habits, such as Louis Stanley, who served as the head chef of the Federal Bureau of Family Economics from 1923 to 1943, which is unprecedented in history.
They publish recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, encouraging women to be "frugal" and brave enough to turn bad food such as creamy pasta with carrots into good food.
"The Big Meal" is a sumptuous "historical treasure."
Of particular interest is the government's response to the hungry, such as President Herbert Hoover's "I can't handle other people's business."
While he has publicly praised the simple Iowa farmhouse of his childhood, his diet is as sophisticated as a millionaire's.
Mr Coe said: "He likes to eat European Western food, such as fish with cucumber sauce."
He was wearing an evening dress and eating in a gilded dining room.
He was clearly separated from the people.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake had it not been for his wife, Eleanor, who encouraged him to set an example in his diet.
As the book says, the housekeeper Ms. Roosevelt hired had no interest in taste, so "the food in the White House was not just the worst food in Washington, but the worst cooked."
As soon as the United States returned to normality, many of the ways of cooking during the Great Depression were abandoned.
What's left, says Ms Zigman, is our focus on calories and nutrition and the application of science to cooking.
The couple said that when they wrote the book, they learned more about Ms. Siegman's mother's eating habits, such as how she doesn't throw food away.
"She was very afraid of wasting food," Mr. Ko said.
"She actually made a lot of people sick," Ms. Sigman recalled.
For example, there has been a "cream puff" incident.
After removing the plates, she and Mr. Coe brought out a dessert they had prepared at home: the fruity pudding that President Roosevelt had for lunch.
"It's called crème brulee," Ms. Sigman said, adding that a trendy name for an ordinary dish is "the usual trick."
There is no whipped cream in this dessert, only preserved fruit, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone grudgingly plunges the spoon into the sticky brown paste.
Surprisingly, this dessert is not bad.
Mr. Ko took a second and a third spoonful.
Feeling that it was an acceptable and affordable dessert, he told his wife, "It would be more delicious with chopped walnuts."
Gilead receives legal fees in hepatitis C patent battle with Merck
According to the U.S. District Judge's decision, Gilead Scientific is entitled to legal fees incurred in the hepatitis C patent lawsuit against the pharmaceutical company Merck Group of America.
In June, after a U.S. judge found Merck guilty of wrongdoing, including perjury and other unethical behavior, Gilead was exempt from paying $200 million in damages for violations of two patents by Gilead's best-selling drugs, Sofibwe and Havoni.
In Thursday's lawsuit, U.S. District Judge Beth Lamberson Freeman said Gilliard did not have to bear the costs incurred by his defense.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, who dominates the market for a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure more than 90 percent of people with the disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other, each claiming to be the owner of the laboratory work at Sofibwe, the active ingredient in Gilead's drugs.
U.S.-backed forces announce they have recaptured Manbij from ISIS
All remaining ISIS soldiers in the city have left and U.S.-backed forces have taken full control of the northern city of Manbij, near the Turkish border, a force spokesman said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now sweeping the city after the departure of militants holed up inside the city.
Sharan Darwish of the Manbij Military Council, an ally of the Syrian Democratic Forces, told Reuters that they had rescued more than 2,000 civilians who had been abducted by militants.
"Manbij is all under our control now, but we're still in the middle of a sweep," he told Reuters.
The Clintons earned $10.75 million in revenue in 2015 and paid 34.2 percent in federal taxes
Hillary Clinton released her 2105 tax returns Friday showing the Democratic presidential nominee and her husband earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 percent in federal taxes.
In 2015, the Clintons made $1 million in charitable contributions, most of which went to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton's speaking fees reached nearly $5.3 million, while the former secretary of state received $3 million from publishers Simon & Schuster for a book about her tenure at the State Department.
Clinton's running mate, Senator Tim Kaine of the Commonwealth of Virginia, and his wife, Anne Holden, released 10 years of tax returns.
The pair paid 20.3 percent in federal taxes in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine will continue to be the benchmark for financial transparency," Clinton campaign aide Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
In contrast, Donald Trump covered up on false grounds and retracted his earlier promise to release his tax returns.
Though not required by law, it is customary for U.S. presidential candidates to make their tax returns public.
As a New York businessman, Trump, along with his lawyers, cited an IRS audit as a reason for refusing to release his tax returns.
Clinton campaign aide Ian Summers tweeted that it's up to you and attached a link to the Democratic nominee's tax returns.
On Thursday, Trump's special counsel, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to release his tax returns until the audit is complete.
Critics of Trump, including 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and other Republicans, said Trump's refusal to release his tax returns would raise questions about his net worth, charitable donations, business dealings and various other relationships, including with Russia.
Clinton seized on the issue to lash out, releasing an online video on Friday highlighting high-profile Democrats urging Trump to release his tax returns.
She raised the issue Thursday during an economic policy speech in Michigan.
"For decades, he refused to release his tax returns like other presidential candidates," she told the crowd.
According to Politico News, Trump paid hardly a penny in taxes for two years in the 1990s, and the New York Times business columnist on Friday quoted a number of tax lawyers and accountants who said that might still be the case.
Federal taxes have become a big issue in the presidential campaign.
Clinton named a rule after billionaire investor Warren Buffett, guaranteeing that people earning more than $1 million a year would pay at least 30 percent in taxes.
President Obama also supported the proposal.
Last week, Clinton held a rally in Omaha, Nebraska, where Berkshire Hathaway's company is based, where Buffett asked Trump to meet and exchange his tax returns.
Mr Buffett said he was also being audited by the IRS, and that Mr Trump was "afraid" not of the tax authorities but of voters.
The earliest tax returns released by the Clinton campaign are from 2007.
The Clintons, who currently live in Chabac, New York, paid an average federal tax rate of about 32 percent and a combined tax rate of about 40.5 percent between 2007 and 2014.
The Clintons' 2015 tax returns show that, unlike most Americans, they are paid as little as $100.
Their main investments are low-cost index mutual funds, and the Clintons have a dividend and interest income of $109,000.

Jewish filmmakers criticise Berlin hotel for removing Israeli phone code as "requested" by Arab customers - Reuters News
A French filmmaker with Jewish roots revealed to the media that the Kempinski Hotel in Berlin did not list the Israeli phone code, and that the hotel staff said it was in accordance with the "requirements" of Arab customers, sparking a public outcry.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary The Holocaust, expressed his disappointment at the Kempinski Hotel and published an open letter in Frankfurt, Germany.
During his most recent stay, Lanzmann wanted to find Israel on the list of phone codes provided by the hotel.
But Israel is not among the countries where guests can call directly from their rooms.
Israel actually disappeared in Berlin, Germany's capital, in 2016?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, guests can call Israel through the Kempinski Hotel's call center.
In search of an explanation, the filmmaker asked the hotel's front desk.
In his letter, Mr Lanzman said he was "shocked" by the response he received at the front desk.
Hotel staff said it was a "deliberate decision by the management of the Kempinski Hotel."
And the reason for doing so has made the filmmaker angry.
Langzman quoted the employee as saying: "Most of our guests are Arabs and they are demanding that the Israeli code be removed."
According to the South German Daily News, Israel's ambassador to Germany, Yakov Haddas Handelsmann, called the incident "an outrage."
We were surprised to learn about the incident.
This in itself is a great shame.
And what happened in Germany and the hotel chain was even more humiliating.
There is no need for any explanation.
"We hope that the hotel will come to the right conclusion," the official said.
The incident sparked a heated debate online and everyone thought it was a scandal.
Some see the Kempinski hotel as simply "kowtowing" to meet the demands of Arab customers.
Another post pointed to the hotel as "shameless" and pointed out that the main street on the famous Kudam Street is near a synagogue.
According to Der Spiegel, the hotel was quick to clarify all the allegations, claiming that everything was "negligent" and offering "apologies" to Lanzmann.
The Nande Daily News quoted Kempinski's representative as saying: "There has never been a direct order to remove Israel from the speed dial list."
The newspaper also said the Israeli code had been added to the list.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets to evict Brazilian students protesting
On Thursday, in Sao Paulo, Brazil, students clashed with police during a protest against reforms to the government's public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets to evict protesters.
The incident began when law enforcement officials tried to disperse the students, so police used rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the march to express their dissatisfaction with the programs.
In an effort to save money, the governor of São Paulo state, Okmin, plans to close 100 public schools and 300,000 students will switch schools.
Some of the students who took part in the protest expressed their displeasure with interim President Michel Temer through graffiti on the wall.
The latest protest comes just days after protesters took to the streets in support of President Dilma Rousseff, who has been impeached by the state Senate.
Scottish cyclist Callum Skinner returns with fame after winning cycling gold
Scottish cyclist Callum Skinner last night helped the British trio successfully defend their Olympic gold medal following the 2012 London Games in the men's team race at the Rio Cycling Stadium.
The 23-year-old Glasgow cyclist replaced his fellow Scot, Sir Chris Hoy, as the centrepiece of the team, and even the legendary cyclist was proud of him when the young Skinner beat title favourite New Zealand and returned home with a reputation.
Four years ago, the British team made a splash, while Hoy won the fifth of the individual's six Olympic gold medals.
Hoey retired after finishing sixth at the World Cycling Championships in London in March.
The problem for the British team between the Beijing and London Games was to replace "first lap expert" Jamie Staff.
The team did just that when Sinders showed up.
Hoy's retirement also left a void that Chin Emadi and Matt Clapton both wanted to fill.
After seeing Skinner's potential, the British men's coaching staff insisted that he be selected for the national team, and Skinner eventually lived up to expectations.
Skinner's partner, Hindes and Kenny, who won gold with Hoy four years ago, set an Olympic record in qualifying but was overtaken by New Zealand in the first round.
And the three British cyclists eventually beat their rivals to win the gold medal.
While Hindes was slightly behind, Kenny took the lead for the team and Skinner held that lead to the end.
A change in strategy was key to the turnaround, with Sinders opting for a larger flywheel and therefore slower, and that allowed Kenny, and Skinner in particular, to keep up the pace.
Hoey watched as a BBC commentator, and Skinner, Kenny and Hinders saw him on the podium.
"I'm flattered," said Mr Skinner, a 23-year-old Glasgow cyclist.
I'm just trying to do what I can to make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record in the final and beat the world champion.
This is unbelievable.
There's nothing better than this win.
After winning gold medals with Kenny and Hoy at the 2012 London Olympics, Sinders admitted to falling deliberately onto the track after a poor start.
He later withdrew the comment, while the British team's rivals were unable to appeal.
And there were no such problems with this victory.
"It's like being in London with the British flag all over the platform," Mr Sinders said.
We only just formed a team three months ago.
We've lost a lot of world championships, so it's amazing to be able to defend an Olympic title.
It's just one race, one gold medal for the British team that won seven of the 10 track cycling gold medals at the Beijing and London Olympics.
If this symbolizes the progress we have made over the past five months, then we will continue to be successful in the Cycling Pavilion for the next five days.
Based on the form Kenny has shown, it's not impossible for him to recreate Hoy's feat of winning three gold medals at one Olympics.
If so, Kenny, who is 12 years younger than Hoy and also born on March 23, which seems to be a sacred day for British sport, when Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born, will have six gold medals and a silver medal.
The result was the same as Hoy's.
Kenny is next in line for the three-day race, which starts today.
"I'm going to focus on this game for the time being," said the 28-year-old Bolton man.
The team competition is always the best.
You can win games with your teammates.
Frankly speaking, it's a bit lonely for one person to win.
"If he can win the other two gold medals, then he should be given a knighthood," Mr Sinders said.
It was the only game of the day that produced a medal, but the British team received other good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owen Doyle advanced to the four-kilometre team pursuit with the fastest time.
Their scores were 351.943.
The world record for a gold medalist at the 2012 London Olympics is 351.659.
The first round and final (10.42pm) take place on the second match day today and Wiggins will no doubt be in the limelight.
He had an argument with match officials before qualifying yesterday when they asked him to measure his height.
Laura Trott, Joanna Rother-Shande, Eleanor Barker and Kate Archibald from Millgate advanced with a new world record of 413.260 in the women's competition, which ends tomorrow.
The British team relied on a strong track cycling team to take the lead in the middle of the Olympics and win a number of medals.
After showing its absolute dominance at the Beijing and London Olympics, the British cycling team was slightly disappointed on their way to Rio.
There were many ups and downs during the period, including the resignation of technical director Sean Sutton in April over sexism and bullying allegations and the retirement of legends such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
But the first night at the Bicycle Pavilion is a testament to the fact that the British team will once again reach the pinnacle of form at the crucial moment.
The future of the Portland smelter is fraught with uncertainty due to the cancellation of the power supply contract
The Portland aluminium smelter in Victoria, as well as hundreds of workers at the plant, is now facing an uncertain future as the power company that powers the plant has revealed that a factory owner will terminate a supply contract, thus invalidating all supply contracts.
The move comes after the Victorian government decided not to continue paying subsidies to keep factories operating.
The 20-year fixed subsidy is due to expire in November.
Two thousand workers at Alcoa's Portland plant could face losing their jobs.
As many as 2,000 people could lose their jobs, directly or indirectly, once the plant closes.
And since the plant accounts for about 10 per cent of Victoria's total electricity output, there could be a knock-on effect.
Alcoa closed the Cape Hanley smelter in 2014, which led to the closure of the Anglesey power plant last year.
Alcoa's Portland smelter is losing money and is at risk of closure.
The move follows forecasts for the plant over the next few years, initially due to a stronger Australian dollar and more recently because of the price of the factory's products.
AGL, which supplies electricity to the large aluminium smelter through the Laoeyang power plant in the Latrobe Valley, predicted that three other plant owners would also terminate their agreement.
The largest shareholder in the plant is a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, while China's Citic Group and Japan's Marubeni Corporation also hold small stakes.
"AGL expects the Portland plant to continue operating, meaning the smelter will continue to generate electricity demand," the joint venture said.
AGL said the contracts were "hedging contracts" that should have been in effect since November 2016.
The contract was terminated for 12 months, so they will be terminated in 2017.
"As a result, AGL still predicts that these contracts will continue to generate revenue in fiscal 2017," the power company said.
Any potential revenue impact on AGL from FY2018 is currently subject to the futures market's optimistic outlook for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL said the company had written down the contract value of $187 million in "termination activity expectations."
Alcoa said the decision to terminate the contracts "will not affect Alcoa's ability to operate the smelter or guarantee the smelter's electricity supply."
The US company said it signed a 20-year contract with Mr Eyang in 2010, which would have taken effect in November, but did not explain why it had withdrawn from the contract.
Analysts are cautious about whether the Portland smelter in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle will close because of the industry's poor economic conditions.
In response to comments from analysts earlier this week, AGL operations chief Stephen Mickelson said Portland uses about 600 megawatts of electricity a year and the Tomago plant about 900 megawatts.
If the two factories shut down, the demand for electricity in the market would be greatly reduced.
"This is not good news for us as an electricity company," he said.
Community legal centres shut out 160,000 people a year
More than 160,000 of the most vulnerable people are turned away from community legal centres each year and the service is already stretched to the limit and now faces further funding cuts.
In Queensland, three out of five people are denied access to free legal advice and representation, mostly elderly people, migrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those who do not have the resources to fight unfair evictions.
The lack of funding for community legal services has long exceeded the limit and now faces further funding cuts.
Federal funding for the centres will be cut by a further 30 per cent from June next year.
James Farrell, the head of the Queensland Community Law Centre, said thousands of people were turned away each year, according to the latest survey by the National Community Association's Law Centre.
Mr Farrell said the situation would only get worse if the federal government did not change existing decisions.
"Queensland's community legal centres are chronically underfunded, which means thousands of people will not be able to access the vital services they need," he said.
People in need of protection from violence, people with huge debts that cannot be paid, families that are falling apart, workers who are being squeezed, all face legal problems, and the report shows that they are unable to get the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by a further 30 per cent from June 2017, meaning thousands of vulnerable people in Queensland will be forced to deal with complex legal issues without help.
We call on Attorney General and Queensland MP George Brandis to reverse these funding cuts immediately so that people can get the help they need when they face legal issues.
Last year, the state government promised to raise legal aid funding to the national average.
Attention must now be given to the needs of the community legal centres and their corresponding communities, and the Bellagio Government must also be involved in this important work.
Donald Trump campaign charged over staff member's draw
New York: Trump's campaign has been sued for inaction after its Northern California chief pulled a gun and pointed it at a staff member while driving a jeep in February.
Vincent Bodini, a former software trainer for the state's campaign, described the incident in a state court in Charlotte on Wednesday.
Mr Bodini said he had previously hoped the matter would be resolved internally, but after months of waiting he realised "this can't happen."
According to Bodini, the man in charge, Earl Phillips, "pulled out a pistol, placed his right index finger on the board, and pointed the gun at Vincent's kneecap."
After complaining to the local and regional campaign leadership, Bodini learned from the dossier that at least four other people had gone through the same thing.
"Failure to shoot does not mean no harm will be done," Mr Bodini said in the complaint.
The case comes just two days after the Republican presidential nominee sparked outrage in North Carolina when he told a crowd that "people who support the Second Amendment," gun owners and gun enthusiasts, could take action if his opponent Hillary Clinton was elected and picked her favorite judge.
Trump's campaign said the media had taken his words out of context and that he was not advocating violence.
In his complaint, Bodini demanded compensation from the campaign for his neglect of supervision, as well as from Phillip for his assault, assault and mental injury.
Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks did not immediately respond to the news.
Philip could not be reached for comment.
Phillip recently left the campaign, according to a local news agency WCCB in Charlotte.
His consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, did not immediately respond to the call.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's campaign has been dogged by controversy.
The parties in this case are Bodini and Trump Presidential Campaign, 16-CS-14300, General Division of the High Court of Mecklenburg County (Charlotte).
Britain must pass on the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also bring energy and prosperity to our communities, London and the country as a whole.
For me, that's the appeal of Heathrow, just as at the 2012 London Olympics we did everything we could to ensure our country and region could benefit from those events.
The Olympics have benefited Stratford and the East End.
And we will once again benefit the region by creating opportunities for local people and businesses around Heathrow.
In our local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and lift young people out of unemployment around the airport.
As before the 2012 London Olympics, some people thought Heathrow's expansion was too big.
I was told that Britain would not be ready for the Olympics and that we would be humiliated in front of the whole world.
The doubters were wrong about the 2012 Olympics, and their doubts about the Heathrow project will be proved wrong.
While there will always be obstacles to overcome, Heathrow is working through every one of the problems it faces.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for the many, not the few.
The expansion will create up to 180,000 new jobs and generate £211bn in economic growth, leaving a wealth of technology and jobs around the airport and across the UK.
We have an excellent Heathrow project team that has completed £11bn of infrastructure investment projects on time and within budget, including Terminal T5, which has been voted the best airport terminal in the world for five years in a row, and Terminal T2, which is located between two of the world's busiest runways.
Now they are preparing to build a third runway with £16bn of private investment.
The UK successfully hosted the 2012 London Olympics, and I am confident that the Heathrow expansion project will also be a huge success.
Now is a good time for us to spread the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow so that we can protect our future and create a wealth of technology and jobs that the UK can be proud of.

A woman has died after killing herself and being run over on a Swiss motorway
The victim was lying on the motorway at midnight.
The woman who tried to kill herself was run over by a number of cars on the highway early Thursday morning and police are looking for witnesses.
The accident happened on the A1 motorway near Morges in the canton of Vaud in the early hours of Thursday morning.
Police in the canton of Vaud said a woman was "desperate" to lie on the road late at night and was run over by multiple vehicles.
The victim, a 49-year-old Swiss woman who apparently acted with suicidal intent, was run over by a number of vehicles, including a lorry.
The woman died at the scene.
Several of the drivers involved have been investigated, but some have yet to be identified, police said, calling on them and witnesses to the accident to come forward for investigation.
Lawyers for Gilles Hofstadter told the Geneva Tribune that a criminal investigation has now been opened, a routine process for such incidents.
But it is not yet known whether any drivers will face charges.
Is it possible to avoid collisions?
Mr Hofstetter said: "It will be up to prosecutors to determine."
Based on the results of two other similar cases in the past five years, the driver will not be held responsible.
Both cases were caused by people taking to the motorway late at night, the paper reported, and the final verdict was that the driver could not have anticipated a pedestrian crossing the motorway at midnight.
Last year, a police officer was charged with causing death by negligence after she struck and killed a man on the A1 motorway near Payet in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim crossed the road after drinking alcohol, the court heard.
After the investigation, the judge said the policewoman was driving in a perfectly legal manner at the time, while the man's presence on the road was "completely unexpected and unpredictable" and that the policewoman called emergency services afterwards.
Anyone with information about the accident near Morges on Thursday should contact police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once suitable for human habitation
According to NASA's new climate models, Venus was once habitable.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies have developed a model that explores the past of Venus, using tools and algorithms that are very similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was used to determine whether Venus, with its high surface temperature, no water and its atmosphere filled with carbon dioxide, ever had an Earth-like environment.
Previously, scientists thought Venus's slower rotation was due to its thicker atmosphere.
But the latest simulations suggest that Venus may have had a thinner, Earth-like atmosphere and was spinning just as slowly.
The model also shows the early topography of Venus.
Venus may have more dry areas than Earth, but there was enough water and geographic change to breed life and prevent rapid evaporation.
In the early days, the light shining on Venus was 30 percent darker than on Earth.
"In the model simulations at the Goddard Institute for Space Research, Venus' slow rotation makes the day on its side nearly two months long," Anthony Del Genio, a scientist at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies, explained in a news release.
This warms the surface and produces rain that forms thick clouds that act like an umbrella to block most of the sun's heat from the ground.
The result of the simulation is that Venus' average climate temperature is actually several degrees lower than Earth's today.
The model simulates the evolution of Venus similar to that previously predicted by planetary scientists.
Although life may have existed on Venus, it was exposed to excessive temperatures and ultraviolet light over the course of billions of years.
The planet's oceans evaporate, and water vapour is burned out by ultraviolet light.
With the escape of hydrogen, all that is left is a thicker atmosphere of carbon dioxide and a deadly greenhouse gas effect, creating Venus as we know it today.
The researchers published the results of a new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as Avalanche manager
Patrick Roe, who stepped down as head coach and vice president of the Colorado Avalanche ice hockey team on Thursday, said he had no say in the team's decision-making.
Joe Sacks, Colorado's executive vice president and general manager, confirmed the news and said the club would immediately start looking for a new head coach.
"Over the past three years, I have fulfilled my responsibilities as head coach and vice president of the Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination," the 50-year-old said in a statement.
I spent the summer thinking hard about how I could improve this team and give it the strength to take it to the next level.
To that end, the manager's and vice president's objectives must be aligned with those of the club.
He also has to have a say in decisions that affect the team's performance.
But for now, these conditions have not been met.
Sacks, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roe for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me about his decision today," Mr Sachs said.
We thank him for his contribution to the club and wish him well in the future.
Roy was nominated for the Jack Adams Award for the league's best coach in his first season coaching the Avalanche in 2013-14.
He helped the club score 112 points and finish first in the central division, but Colorado was eliminated by Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs and missed the playoffs in the last two years.
The Avalanche finished with 39 wins, 39 draws and four losses in the 2015-16 season, and eventually lost their second wild-card spot in the Western Conference by five points.
As a Hall of Fame goalie, Roe has won four Stanley Cups, two each while playing for the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea oil field workers stop strike, continue negotiations
The chief negotiator said workers at North Sea oil fields had halted strikes over pay and the parties to the dispute had begun a new round of negotiations.
There have been a number of strikes against oil field services company Wood Group on North Sea oil platforms operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
According to a joint statement, "Wood Group and the Unite and RMT unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the process of resolving the current dispute."
We will be reviewing these issues with a number of full-day meetings in the coming weeks, starting early next week.
The union said its recent action, the first of its kind in 25 years, was in protest at a possible pay cut of up to 30 per cent.
Wood Group has reduced compensation for North Sea contractors by about 9 per cent this year because of market pressures.
The pay cut comes after the company cut compensation for offshore contractors by 10 per cent in 2014.
The company said another pay cut would help the company ride out the market slump.
Shell has cut thousands of jobs and announced plans to shut down oil and gas equipment in 10 countries because of the need to streamline its operations following its merger with British energy company British Gas.
Energy companies are coming under pressure from lower crude oil prices and the UK's decision to leave the European Union in June.
Scottish Parliament member Dave Anderson met union leaders earlier this week to discuss the biggest labour dispute of the North Sea generation.
He said the North Sea was vital to the region's economy.
"In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that works for the many, not the few," Dave said in the statement.
Spending on new projects in the North Sea is expected to be no more than $1.4 billion in 2016, compared with an average of around $7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler measures the rotation speed of the stars in the Pleiades cluster
The Kepler Space Telescope's latest mission has helped astronomers capture the most complete rotation of stars in the Pleiades cluster.
The new data is helping astronomers understand why the cluster's stars rotate at different speeds and how their rotation cycles are related to the composition of the planet.
"We hope to learn more about the relationship between star mass, age, and even the history of their solar system by comparing our results with other clusters," Luza Rebble, a research scientist at the Infrared Processing and Analysis Center at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, said in a press release.
The star cluster is 445 light-years away from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster were born about 125 million years ago and are now just reaching adulthood.
They reached the highest speed of rotation in their lifetime.
At their maximum speed of rotation, these mature stars shoot out large amounts of stellar wind.
When these stellar winds pass through the star's magnetic field, they act as a brake on the star.
As a star ages, its rotation begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of stars by tracking the appearance of identifiable sunspots, such as sunspots.
The latest set of rotation speed data indicates that the rotation speed of the more massive stars is slower than that of the less massive stars.
Rybl compared stars to dancers, with larger dancers spinning more slowly than smaller ones.
"In the" ballet performance "of the Pleiades cluster, we found that stars with slower rotation tend to be more massive, while those with the fastest rotation tend to be the lightest," says Mr Reble.
Because of its close proximity, the Pleiades cluster could serve as an ideal cosmic laboratory for comparing the mass of stars with the speed of rotation.
"The Pleiades cluster provides the foundation for theoretical models of two-way rotation of young and old stars," says Mr Reble.
We still have a lot to learn about how, when, and why stars slow down their rotation and "put away their dancing shoes."
Ribble and her colleagues detailed their latest analysis of the rotation speed of the star cluster in three new papers, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
