&quot; This 5,000 RMB subsidy really resolved my current crisis . &quot;
Zhou Fen , a girl from a poor household for which information has been recorded and archived , living in Mipo Village , Changle Township , Huayuan County , received an admission notice from Nanhua University .
Just as she started to worry about tuition fees , the county committee of the league provided her with a timely sum of aid money of 5,000 RMB on August 9 .
For days , relevant departments in the counties have provided 2.838 million RMB of bursaries for over 690 college students from poor families .
For families facing extremely difficult economic situations , social donations for school subsidies are also organized to help students complete their academic careers .
For this year , Huayuan has consolidated a sum of over 18.50 million RMB for academic scholarships and independently financed a sum of over 2.5 million RMB for this purpose . The financial department will transfer the fees to a named bank account of the needy students within the specified time period .
She thankfully said : &quot; I thought my older brother and I would never make it to college after my father passed away . We never thought that the county will promptly provide us with assistance to address the issue . &quot;
As of August 8 , Huayuan has provided poor students with over 21 million RMB in subsidies and bursaries for 13,140 poor students for the first half of this year .
Every poor student in this county has received financial assistance and subsidy .
At the site , reporters saw a large container tractor unit parking next to the fast lane under the direction of the traffic police . The container has fallen on the landscape lane , creating a pit 2-cm deep by the road side .
According to news from Xinhuanet , the New South Wales state government of Australia will be spending 200 million Australian Dollars ( approximately equivalent to 154 million USD ) for the largest renovation project for the Sydney Opera House since the construction of the building .
The restoration will not change the shell shape of the theater , said the NSW government .
The Sydney Opera House designed by Danish architect Jørn Utzon was completed in 1973 , receiving around 8 million visitors annually as a urban landmark .
​ Sydney Symphony Orchestra Managing Director Rory Jeffes believed that the Sydney Opera House would use this renovation to &quot; turnaround &quot; and become &quot; a concert hall with the greatest acoustics in the world . &quot;
Non-residents of Beijing who have lived in Beijing for more than six months , and comply with the one of the conditions of having legal and stable employment , legal and stable residence or continuous study , may apply for a residence permit .
Recently , Beijing issued detailed rules for the implementation of the Interim Rules on Residence Permit . This implies that the &quot; temporary residence permit &quot; will be upgraded to &quot; residence permit . &quot;
Head officials of relevant departments said that the transformation of &quot; temporary residence permit &quot; to &quot; residence permit &quot; meant that the City of Beijing will move away from &quot; managing &quot; long-term residents from outside the city and instead provide them with a wide selection of services .
Reporters learned from the State Administration of Taxation that as of end-June this year , tax authorities at various levels have disclosed a tax violation &quot; blacklist &quot; comprising 2470 cases .
It was reported that in July 2014 , the State Administration of Taxation took the first step among the functional departments of the Central Government , and announced the Measures for the Administration of Taxpayer Creditworthiness together with the Measures for Announcing Information Concerning Major Unlawful Tax Practices .
Not only will the facts of malfeasance , legal basis , and the handling and punishment pertaining to these cases be released to the public , the basic information of the perpetrators as well as the relevant competent persons of the intermediaries will also be listed in a &quot; blacklist &quot; and disclosed .
Quality inspections , finances , customs , and other government institutions also implemented punitive measures against parties on the &quot; blacklist . &quot;
&quot; Credit score repair is an important milestone for building tax credit system , and even the social credit system . It signifies continuous development , perfection , and maturation in building a social credit system in our country . &quot;
&quot; Environmental problems are reflected in air , water , and soil pollution but are ultimately rooted in production methods and lifestyle . &quot;
For example , in 2015 , the extent of land development in Jiangsu Province was 21 % , the highest among all provinces and autonomous regions in the country .
Therefore , there has been a lack of radical response to issues pertaining to heavy pollution , big energy and large land coverage in terms of a change in production methods and lifestyle .
On the one hand , based on the results of the establishment of various levels and types of ecological environment in Jiangsu Province , it ranks first on an overwhelming basis . On the other hand , however , the resource environment in under significant pressure .
Effective promotion of ecological conservation and governance requires a fundamental transformation of production methods and lifestyles . An ecological and civilized approach to development can promote and benefit everyday life .
In November , 42 pieces of wind turbine blade manufactured by China Guodian Corporation were loaded at Lianyungang port for export to South Africa .
Since last year , Guodian Corporation has exported a total of 163 wind power projects to South Africa from the Port of Lianyungang .
The third party company ( non-Chinese company ) commissioned by the International Olympic Committee to manufacture the flags is located in the State of São Paulo 75 kilometers away from the City of São Paulo .
To urge manufacturers to complete their work as soon as possible , the Chinese Embassy in Sao Paulo arranged for experts to go to the manufacturers to perform detailed work .
After 30 hours of overtime , the manufacturer finally finished making the Chinese flags and loaded them for shipment , completing a task that was to have taken four to five working days ahead of time .
It was reported that the flag is expected to arrive in Rio on the 11th . The Olympic Committee , upon receiving the flag , will deliver it to all the Olympic stadiums . The Chinese Embassy in Brazil will oversee the entire process until its completion .
According to our correspondents , on the 10th day , the Nantong city government held a Shanghai-Nantong Business Partnership Bidding at the Shanghai International Convention Center . Over 180 Shanghai businesses were invited to the event and signed , at the site , projects worth over 2 billion RMB for Shanghai-Nantong business projects .
Total investments for 20 projects of the centralized agreement amounted to 8.063 billion RMB , and involves multiple sectors such as new energy , new materials , and modern services .
Qingdao is the 12th city in the nation and the first in Shandong Province to implement the pilot program for paying for the use and trading of emissions rights .
On the 11th , many companies submitted emission rights purchase applications at the Qingdao Emissions Trading Center . Those who successfully applied for the rights will start paying a usage fee .
The imminent completion of this first trade also marks the official launch of the pilot program for the trading of emission rights in Qingdao . This will also be the first emission rights trade in the Province as well as the first city-level emission rights trade in the nation .
In the morning of the 11th , Zhao Xiuping , general manager of Qingdao Shuangtao Jingxi Chemical Industry ( Group ) came to the Qingdao City Emissions Trading Center to submit an application to purchase emission rights .
This corporation , situated in the factory area of Old Town of Qingdao , stopped its production lines at the end of last year , and was moved , using environment-friendly means , to a new plant area in Pingdu .
Zhao Xiuping submitted the application form , environmental impact report , and other materials for the construction project . The Qingdao City Emissions Reserve and Trading Service Center began preliminary reviews of the application materials .
According to the collection criteria determined by Qingdao &apos;s pricing , finance and other departments , the initial usage fee for emissions rights is currently estimated at approximately RMB641,200 . Staff will complete checking and ratification within seven working days .
The first transaction , which will be completed soon , also marks the formal initiation of the Qingdao Emissions Trading Pilot Project . This will also be the first emissions trading in the province and the first city-level emissions trading in the entire country .
Zhao Xiuping said , &quot; Presently , enterprises have invested RMB400 million in environmental protection . On the surface , this seems an enormous amount , but it has a profound impact on both the operational and management philosophy of enterprises as well as social benefit , and has provided room for innovative management by enterprises .
On that day , Qingdao Sifang Xincheng Zhizhuo Coach Components Co . , Ltd. also came to apply for and purchase emission rights for the project to produce 4,200 pieces of interior accessories and components for high speed train and electric multiple units .
This project is initiated by a mechanical processing company . The company is applying for an initial emissions as chemical oxygen demand ( COD ) of 0.514 tons / year and ammonia nitrogen ( NOX ) of 0.052 tons / year .
Paying for the use and trading of air pollutant emissions rights is for the city &apos;s key power and heat production and supply industrial enterprises .
Existing polluting companies that have received a bad rating prior to January 1 , 2016 will be temporarily exempt from the usage fee .
&quot; Paying for emission rights does not mean gaining the right to generate illegal emissions . The payer may not emit waste as they like . &quot;
Deputy Director Han Hongyan of the Qingdao Environmental Protection Bureau explained that illegal emissions or emissions that exceed specified limits shall be subject to penalties according to relevant laws . Violating companies will not be able to purchase emission rights to avoid punishments .
In another word , we should fight against environmental offense and excessive discharge by enterprises with serious legal action to protect our environment and public health .
Enterprises are now more enthusiastic about pollution treatment because of their own interests ; limited emission rights are valued , and emission of pollutants has decreased .
Driven by economic interest , reducing emission of pollutants will shift from mandatory acts imposed by the government to conscious corporate market behavior . Thus , the goal of protecting the environment and nature as well as ensuring public health will be achieved .
The right to discharge pollutants , or &quot; emission rights , &quot; are a right to emit pollutants , i.e. , polluters , within a quota allocated by the government , enjoy the right to discharge pollutants into the environment according to the law .
This right is in essence , the right polluters have on the ownership , use and profit of existing resources in the environment .
In the next step , under the pretext of keeping total emissions within the allowable emission volume , various internal sources of pollution shall use currency exchange to modulate emissions .
Emissions trading was first proposed by the US economist Dales in 1968 . In the 1970s , the US made use of this to manage sources of atmospheric and river pollution .
Pilot programs were initiated since 2007 . Currently , the program is being fully implemented at Zhejiang , Jiangsu , and other 14 provinces ( in districts and cities ) .
Information given by the Russian Ministry of Defense said that in order to support the 6 strategic bombers to conduct air strikes of &quot; Islamic State &quot; targets within Syria , multiple Russian military aircraft has taken off from the Khmeimim Air Base from Syria to provide assistance .
On February 22 this year , the US and Russia has reached an agreement on a general ceasefire for the Syrian conflict . The ceasefire agreement will be enforced starting on the 27th day of the month .
According to the agreement , the ceasefire does not apply to military strikes implemented against the Islamic State , the al-Nusra Front , and other UN-recognized terrorist groups .
Russia will continue to construct relevant military infrastructure at this base so that the living conditions of Russian soldiers will be ensured .
He added that if extremist organizations are not suppressed , these forces will spread to Russia .
Although Russia and the West have yet to achieve a consensus in beating back extremist forces in Syria , Russia will be stepping up its partnerships with Syria , Iran , and Iraq relating to this matter .
In September 2015 , at the invitation of the Syrian government , Russia commenced military strikes against extremist forces in Syria .
On March 15 this year , Russia has withdrawn its main military forces for Syria . However , Russia promises that it will continue to maintain a garrison at the Khmeimim Air Base and Tartus Naval Base .
In the revival of old residences and successful village entrepreneurship cases , He Peijun gave a very good demonstration : Inheritance of a century-old home and the telling of a story on the inheritance of a piece of land .
To date , about 100,000 people will visit Zhushan every year , some bring various kinds of creativity , while others seek inner solace .
In fact , the rural-urban relationship should be one of companionship , like mother and child , without the difference between strong and weak , without requiring who was to govern whom ; it should be very warm .
There are no fixed model for rural development , but it is extremely difficult for a village to achieve changes on its own . The most important point is to ensure that the right people is sent to the villages .
Departments of traffic control at Songjiang District of Shanghai City recently made use of electronic police to address the issue of using the cellphone while driving . 30 violators were identified within a week .
As smart phones become more prevalent , mobile phones have become more fun . Swiping weixin , sending weibos , and even playing games and shopping on Taobao have become the norm . Many appear unable to leave their mobile phones alone for even an instant , even when driving .
The Road Traffic Safety Law expressly prohibits using one &apos;s mobile phone while driving , and has defined it as &quot; obstructing safe driving . &quot;
Shamefully , due to the number of violators and difficulties in gathering evidence , this phenomenon has not been properly punished . The law , it seems , is only for show .
If traffic control departments are determined to &quot; declare war &quot; against drivers using mobile phones and establish legal actions as standard practice , such violations can be controlled accordingly .
Household registration files must be stringently managed . Digital and printed household registration files must be established for personnel with no household registration to ensure the comprehensiveness and effectiveness of the file documents .
Public security bureaus should promptly notify the status of registering those without household registration permits to the relevant departments .
Policies and measures not consistent with the principle of the opinions regarding this implementation shall be cleaned out at once . Changes shall be enforced thoroughly , and things that should be removed must be terminated without hesitation .
In the large collective greenhouse of Donglin Village , Taicang City , workers , led by 48-year-old Wang Xuefen , are spraying pesticide on pear trees .
Twelve workers and one technician are enough for the 150mu groove with 10 varieties .
Last year , the total amount of money was fifty thousand . At my age , I definitely couldn &apos;t make this amount of money if I were to work at a factory .
Last year , village-level revenue of Donglin Village reached 22.00 million , of which agricultural income accounted for nearly half of this figure .
Village Secretary Su Qifang : arable land area per capita is rising each year . It was 50 mu initially , and more than 100 mu now ; average efficiency per mu is also rising annually . There is also room for the income of professional farmers to grow each year as well .
Shares have been quantified and distributed to every villager . The biggest highlight of the Sunan Rural Collective Economy Reform is clearly stipulating the ownership of business operation assets of the rural collective and investigating the separation of politics and economy .
The 14 Rural Economic Cooperatives （ REC ) in Anzhen Neighborhood , Xishan Dis . , Wuxi and their corresponding village committees adopted the &quot; account-divided management &quot; from July , 2015 . The committees were responsible for public affair , while the cooperatives for operation .
The two institutions will keep separate accounting books to avoid &quot; overlaps . &quot; This will prevent village officials from engaging in corrupt practices when managing collective assets .
According to Zhu Baoping , deputy director of the Jiangsu Agriculture Committee , the next step for Jiangsu is to continue to promote reforms pertaining to the community joint stock cooperative system , encourage joint development among farmers , and establish a village-level operating mechanism for democratic rights .
Zhu Baoping : Expand the scope of reforms , implement community shareholding and partnerships , ensure that assets are distributed to community members , ensure fixed shareholding benefits to the farmers , and establish a clear ownership over the industry .
By way of Internet + , his right to know , right to participate in decision-making , and right to supervise democratic administration are put into practice . The implementation of these three rights for farmers has indeed made it a standard joint stock cooperative operating mechanism .
Currently , the new collective economy of Sunan Village is primarily comprised of four development models - the asset lease model , the stock enterprise model , the agricultural development model and the united development model .

Zhang Binbin , a daughter of Xiamen , had &quot; wonderful hand posture &quot; and experienced multiple &quot; reversals &quot; during her career as a shooter .
Zhang Donghong , a resident at Dongyuan Village at Xiang &apos;an District in Xiamen , just swapped his old 29-inch television for a large 65-inch set several days ago .
This daughter of a common farmer is Zhang Binbin , who just won a silver medal for China in the 50 meter rifle three positions in the Rio Olympics .
During the evening of the 11th , Zhang Donghong , his wife , and dozens of other family members and friends stood before this new television and witnessed how his daughter started a miraculous spree that brought her from the brink of being dropped out of the competition to a medal winning score .
On the day of the competition , Zhang Binbin had a mid to low ranking at one point , and a spot in the final appeared extremely remote .
Parents , family , and friends did not give up , and continued to watch to live stream . When the other athletes completed their firing , Zhang Binbin &apos;s rank kept rising until she secured the right to compete in the finals . Everyone at her home exploded in a great cheer .
In the finals , Zhang Binbin , who again fell behind in the rankings at one point , became increasingly steady as she fired the last few shots . She finished just 0.2 points behind the champion , clinching the silver medal .
Across her 16-year shooting career , Zhang Binbin , who is 27-year old this year , brushed past this hard-won silver medal on several occasions .
The mother , Zhang Xiaolong , told the reporter that when everyone was still hesitant , Zhang Binbin found several &quot; young persuaders &quot; from the same village .
The &quot; little lobbyists &quot; are the kids from the same family participated the training by recommendation at hat time , including the cousin of Zhang Binbin .
Not long after entering the Xiamen team , Zhang Binbin once again actively returned to study at a school in Xiang &apos;an due to family difficulties and other reasons .
Zhang Binbin returned to Xiamen Team after being repeatedly persuaded by her first coach Zhang Yajie .
After joining the provincial team , Zhang Binbin , who took a long time to advance to the national team , returned home at one point because she saw no hope .
This visit included more than just Coach Zhang Yajie . Official leaders and coaches from the Xiamen Shooting Shejian Sports Center and Fujian Provincial Team also came by and successfully persuaded Zhang Binbin to return to the provincial team .
Just like the competition yesterday , this daughter of Xiamen persisted and once again turned the tables in her shooting career .
&quot; Every coach has different way of picking team members . At the time , I noticed that Binbin has really nice hands , and fell in love with them immediately . &quot;
Zhang Donghong also recalled that although his daughter &apos;s performance was not the best at the group training test , the number of rounds she shot was very stable . This was also a key factor why Zhang Binbin attracted the attention of her coach .
During training , the farm girl Zhang Binbin was so committed that she left a lasting impression with Zhang Yajie .
He recollected that more than one year after Zhang Binbin joined the Xiamen shooting team , the team conducted a standing posture rifle firing training . Team members were required to stand still for half an hour .
Zhang Xiaolong told the reporter that her daughter is a quiet and obedient child and has loved drawing and making her own toys since a young age .
&quot; Originally , I stayed at home to tailor some clothes , sewing and mending them as needed . Binbin would sit by the corner , collecting the scrap fabrics to make her own fabric doll . &quot;
She said that her daughter would often sew and make her own toys . Coupled with the fact that she was good at drawing , she was able to create a lifelike face and clothing for the dolls she made .
As an athlete , Zhang Binbin spends little time with family , and could only return home during weekends and public holidays . Usually , they communicate using the telephone .
Her parents said that whether when meeting in person or talking on the phone , Zhang Binbin seldom said she found things difficult . More often than not , she would chat about happy things with parents .
Since they hardly see their daughter , the parents carefully preserved the artwork that their girl has made as a child and the glories that she had later won .
Zhang Xiaolong showed the reporter the cartoon artwork his daughter created . &quot; If she didn &apos;t become a archer , she would probably continue to draw . &quot;
There is a cabinet located at the second floor living room in Zhang Binbin &apos;s home that is filled with the plaques , medals , and certificates that she had won .
Zhang Donghong displayed the medals and awards neatly , and kept all the certificates in a folder . &quot; These are the honors Binbin has received over the years on the basis of her hard work and dedication . All of us cherish them . &quot;
Recently , the Cixiao Foundation of Hebei Province has delivered consolation money of 16,000 RMB to 6 families at the villages of Xiaozuo , Taitou , and Guiquan in Jingjing County who had lost a loved one .
This is yet another consolation and care campaign initiated by the Fund after their previous search for &quot; Lost Youths , Children , and Elderly Victims of the July 19 Flood . &quot;
Heavy rain on July 19 affected multiple areas in Hebei Province , leading to floods to parts of the province with people going missing and dying as a result .

August 12 news report by Oriental Daily , a Hong Kong news company , said that there are 3 major issues of diamond sales in Mainland China . This includes false labeling of diamond purity to drive up prices , false labeling of diamond mass , and lack of post-sales guarantee .
Antwerp is the largest diamond trading center in the world . Diamond cutting skills of local craftsman are famous throughout the world . The diamonds sold through the city have been stringently classified and are extremely popular amongst women in China .
&quot; A small palm-sized cloth bag , light and airy , is worth nearly a million , &quot; a lady surnamed Liu purchasing diamonds on behalf of another was describing her experience at Antwerp in June this year to domestic media .
She said that she hid the diamonds in her underwear . For a few days in a row , she would carry them along with her to the toilet and when she took a shower . She felt extremely nervous even when she was walking or sleeping .
She claimed that diamonds purchased at Antwerp sold for a price of about 55,000 RMB per carat . Diamonds of the same quality could fetch a retail sales price of 111,000 at Xiamen .
She sold all the diamonds she purchased as agent at a 20 % premium to the purchase price , and made a huge lump-sum profit of 200,000 yuan .
Inland customs regulations stipulate that diamond are not necessities nor are used by the travelers during their trips , and would therefore be regarded as a merchandise and must be declared when entering or leaving the country . Failure to do so would be considered an act of trafficking which is punishable with a prison sentence for serious offenses .
Overseas media reported that at 10 AM , local time , the British Prime Minister &apos;s residence at Downing Street announced : British Prime Minister Teresa May will be taking her summer vacation at Switzerland . However , no information has been provided on the exact location of her trip .
Some media said that after the UK referendum to leave the European Union , the new British Prime Minister opted to have a vacation in Switzerland that has been regarded as a &quot; neutral state &quot; in continental Europe , and act that may be symbolic in terms of policy .
A comment in The Guardian claimed that the neutral symbolism of Switzerland has played a role in the UK Prime Minister &apos;s choice of her first holiday destination .
A review in the UK &apos;s The Daily Telegraph pointed out that Theresa May chose to holiday in Switzerland . This was the first time a UK Prime Minister holidayed in Switzerland after Mrs Thatcher .
The choice of the two female Prime Ministers contrasts with that of the two male Prime Ministers , Blair and Cameron , who liked to holiday in warmer places .
It was reported that Theresa May , the new Prime Minister of Great Britain , will return to London on August 24 . What awaits her next is a series of important tasks and activities .
The British parliament will resume on September 5 . Topics for debate include holding a second Brexit referendum as requested online .
In June 23 , the British launched a referendum to leave the European Union ( EU ) . However , the new British Prime Minister is unwilling initiate the contents of Article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon regarding to withdrawal of member states from the EU before the end of the year .
There are 1,325 intangible cultural and heritage assets in Huangshan City , giving the city the largest number and categories of such assets in the entire province .
As the transmission of the intangible cultural heritage of the Hui culture relies primarily on oral and face-to-face tradition , much intangible cultural heritage is on the brink of extinction . Using digital technology to store and protect it is imperative .

Upon receiving a single order given by the chief director located at the military exercise directing department located in Kashgar , Xinjiang , military police stationed in Kashgar , Hotan , and Aksu quickly mobilized and assembled according to deployment commands and headed for the exercise combat zones .
China &apos;s Mars program unveiled
The task of the Mars exploration mission of China is to achieve orbiting , landing , and inspection . Such format has never been carried out before in other countries .
China &apos;s Mars exploration launch target is to orbit , land and inspect in one attempt . This was a difficult mission .
The time window for exploring Mars happen only every 26 months . Experts are drawing up a stringent construction plan to launch our country &apos;s first Mars probe when the opportunity arrives in 2020 .
According to Xu Dazhe , although our country &apos;s space vehicle has been delivered into deep space , completion of a Mars exploration mission is indispensable . Mars exploration will mark the step by which China enters the era of deep space exploration .
&quot; Mars comes closest to Earth only once every two or three years . Launching a Mars probe then would be most energy efficient for a carrier rocket . &quot;
&quot; Taking into consideration the quality of the Mars probe , the launch mission will be completed by our Long March 5 carrier rocket . &quot;
China &apos;s mission to explore Mars aims to orbit , land and inspect in one attempt . This form has never been attempted overseas . A foreign mission had once attempted to orbit and land but the landing failed .
Mars exploration covers a large number of technological fields . Despite being a space exploration device , the unique feature of the device is that it has distinctive characteristics that set it apart from general space exploration probes .
In other words , the Mars exploration vehicle must be given the ability to determine driving routes and detect obstacles and hazards .
Pang Zhihao , researcher at China Academy of Space Technology said that the reason why human beings are so keen to explore Mars is because it has major scientific , technological and various other significance , and is even related to the future of humanity .
Currently , Mars is the best-studied planet by the human race . The use of space probes for Mars exploration almost permeates the entirety of human aerospace history .
Hence , the human race hopes to construct a residential base on Mars in the future , colonize the planet , and make it a second home for the species .
Large volumes of evidence suggest that Mars , in the past , may be like present day earth , and only assumed its current form with thin atmosphere , low temperature , and dwindling water resources after an process of change lasting billions of years .
Therefore , inspecting or sending manned spacecraft to Mars for study will help us find solution to prevent earth become a uninhabitable Mars , the second .
As of June 2016 , 114 lunar explorations and 43 Mars explorations had been carried out worldwide .
However , since the 1990s , the human race has launched a total of 18 Mars exploration missions . In comparison , only 14 Lunar exploration missions had been carried out .
At this time , five Mars orbiters and two Mars rovers are in operation , but only one lunar orbiter and one lunar lander are in operation .
Leading countries in the aerospace industry have stipulated exploration projects that target the planet Mars . This demonstrates that in modern times , Mars exploration is more popular than lunar exploration .
On November 5 , 2013 , India launched its first Mars exploration probe Mangalyaan , and became the first country in Asia to successfully start a Mars exploration mission .
&quot; Mangalyaan &quot; is used to study the surface , atmospheric , and mineral characteristics of Mars to search whether there are methane and signs of life on the planet .
The most challenging part of this mission is that the probe has only one chance for its aerodynamic shape and parachute to decelerate when it enters the Martian atmosphere
According to Sun Zezhou , chief designer of the Mars exploration vehicle at the integrated department of facility 5 of the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation , the Mars exploration mission faces many technical challenges .
The atmospheric pressure on Mars , at only 1 % that on Earth , has significant uncertainties .
Scientists have yet to arrive at a clear understanding about its changes , the properties of the storms , and other functions .
As Mars experiences sand storms familiar with those on the earth , the rover will not receive enough solar energy for operation . Therefore , it has to have a &quot; Sleeping &quot; mode till the end of the storm .
The atmosphere of Mars will also weaken incoming solar radiation , providing yet another challenge to power supply for Mars exploration .
This requires the probe to have larger solar panels that must be constantly adjusted to direct them towards the sun .
In addition , the surface gravity on Mars is only 38 % that of Earth , but is a lot larger than that on the Moon . Therefore , a probe with more power is required .
&quot; The most central and hardest part of this Mars exploration mission is the aerodynamic configuration and the parachute deceleration process after the probe enters the atmosphere of Mars . There is only one opportunity , and ensuring its success is critical . &quot;
Sun Zezhou said that as Earth was a long distance away from Mars , it was impossible to control the entire process on a real-time basis . Therefore , a probe is required to complete the mission autonomously .
As there was insufficient propellant to offset such a high speed , when landing on Mars , deceleration would depend on the effect of the Martian atmosphere . The atmosphere on Mars however , is difficult to simulate on Earth .
Pang Zhihao said , &quot; On the whole , the methods used to explore Mars and the Moon are similar . It also involves &quot; orbit , land , inspect , return , &quot; ultimately achieving the goal of bringing people to Mars .
As Mars is further away from Earth than the Moon , exploring Mars requires overcoming a series of more complex technical difficulties .
Taiwan media reported that Taiwan &quot; Legislative Yuan Premier &quot; Lin Chuan announced yesterday morning that the &quot; Rule for Managing Ill-gotten Assets by Political Parties and Their Affiliates &quot; will become effective from today .
Steve Chan , Vice Chairman of the Kuomintang said , &quot; With a history of more than a century , the Kuomintang has social commitment and responsibility , and will not collapse just like that . &quot;
Lin Chuan emphasized that any political party , affiliated organization , or commissioned manager who violates the penalty provisions of the Act , the member of the Committee shall exercise their duties and enforce punishment and penalties in &quot; accordance with the law . &quot;
Lin Chuan also announced that Hung Pai-ken , Taiwan &apos;s &quot; Agency Against Corruption Deputy Director-General , &quot; will be the Vice Chairman candidate for the Ill-gotten Party Assets Settlement Committee .
He said that Koo Li-hsiung is the best pick as the chairperson of the Ill-gotten Party Assets Settlement Committee . Koo shall make use of Hung Pei-ken &apos;s experiences in handling major cases of similar nature and use the experiences as the basis for investigating cases related to ill-gotten party assets .
Steve Chan believed that as long as party assets exist today , no one will give public donations . If party assets were to be completely confiscated , this would be just the right time for the Kuomintang to ask for public support and sponsorship . &quot; Only if we have nothing today will we have the opportunity to ask . &quot;
Chan Chi-hsien emphasized that even if the act on handling ill-gotten party assets is enforced , any remaining Kuomintang asset that has yet to be fully nationalized or confiscated shall be donated according to his promise . Kuomintang assets shall be completely liquidated for the Party to start from square one .
Original title : &quot; Corridor doctor &quot; Lan Yuefeng loses defamation suit against CCTV host Wang Zhi &apos;an
Fawan ( legal evening news ) reported that Lan Yuefeng has pressed charges against Wang Zhian as well as Beijing Weibo Internet Technology Co . , Ltd. for posts published by the China Central Television anchor Wang Zhian on Sina Weibo regarding the &quot; corridor physicians &quot; incident .
Yesterday afternoon , Haidian Court pronounced judgment on this case , and ruled that the conduct of Wang Zhi &apos;an and Microdream Co . , Ltd. did not constitute infringement , rejecting all the legal claims of Lan Yuefeng .
In early 2014 , CCTV reporter Wang Zhian found during an investigation that Lan Yuefeng , who had been sitting in the hospital corridor for more than 600 days , have been established by the media as a tragic heroine oppressed by the system . However , many such reports contain a great deal of misinformation .
On March 29 , 2014 , CCTV News investigated the broadcast of the production of the Corridor Doctor program .
Lan Yuefeng has informed the media of various so-called excessive medical treatment but has not provided any evidence to substantiate her claims .
Wang Zhian also posted on a Weibo account that have been verified to his real name that &quot; Lan Yuefeng reached this step partly because of her personality that is characterized by distinctive paranoia . &quot;
Lan Yuefeng demanded Wang Zhian to delete the Weibo posts , apologize to her , and pay a compensation of 100,000 RMB for psychological damage that she has endured .
During the court proceedings , both parties engaged in a hot debate whether Wang Zhian violated Lan Yuefeng &apos;s right to reputation .
Highlights for the 12th : China Team busy at work in athletics - Women &apos;s football entering the Top-4 - Cyclists seeking breakthrough
There is a chance to achieve a breakthrough for &quot; zero gold medals &quot; for bicycle events in the Olympics . The women &apos;s football team will also challenge the German team , the two-times world champion , and people have hopes that they might make it to the top-4 .
Wang Zhen has exhibited outstanding performance for the last 2 seasons , winning a silver medal in the IAAF World Championships in Athletics in Beijing last year and became a personal event champion in the Group IAAF Race Walking Challenge in May this year .
Foreign media reported that 27-year-old archer Chang Hye-jin won the gold medal for the women &apos;s individual archery event after clinching a gold medal in the team event . She is now a double champion .
Zhang Huizhen is regarded as an athlete who achieved her glories late in her career . She was once unable to enter the London Olympics , but finally made it to the prestigious podium for the Rio Olympics .
In the women &apos;s archery singles held at the Rio &apos;s Samba Stadium in Brazil , Zhang Huizhen defeated Lisa Unruh from Germany with a total score of 6-2 .
An athlete who attained fame later than most others , she shot her first arrow only when she was in Primary 4 , and only received her first individual gold medal at the world cup tournament in 2014 when she was 27 years old .
Chang Hye-jin reminisced : &quot; There was little quality before junior high school , and provided no opportunities in joining national competitions .
Chang Hye-jin has only obtained the 4th place during the qualifiers for the London Olympics , and missed her chance to attend the event . She could only sit by and watch her colleague and friend Ki Bo-Bae winning 2 gold medals .
After the medal ceremony for the women &apos;s individual archery event , Chang Hye-jin expressed her feelings about winning the gold medal , &quot; Up to the very last , I did my best at every arrow I shot . Perhaps this led to good results . I &apos;m very happy . &quot;
The Bronze Medal was won by the 28-year-old Bo-bae , known as No. 1 Archer Lady in South Korea and the gold medal winner of archery in the London Olympic Games .
Ki Bo-Bae lost to Chang Hye-jin in the semi-finals , and was then matched up against the Mexican athlete Alejandra Valencia .
Ki Bo-bae wept after it was confirmed that she had won the bronze medal . One could only imagine the burden of having to win a gold medal that she had to suffer in silence in the interim .
The training team accumulated plenty of experience during continuous research . Scientific training method comes in second . All these can only be acquired through many years of learning .
The archery team employed military training , crossing cemeteries at night and other methods to help team members focus and concentrate as well as to take things in stride .
Although it has yet to be proven , many information sources indicate that Apple will hold its 2016 Fall event in September. iPhone 7 is really on its way .
Although Apple did not respond , news concerning the functions and configuration of the iPhone are being released gradually . Pictures of the &quot; actual phone model &quot; have even appeared on the Internet .
The new iPhone could be considered a &quot; public phenomenon . &quot; It &apos;s popular , sleek , and could not be acquired even if you have the money to pay for it . If you want to buy an original product , you must opt for a proper sales channel such as Suning .
This heightened the people &apos;s sense of disappointment for the new cellphone . &quot; It became longer , but couldn &apos;t project holographs ! This iPhone release sucks . &quot;
Like other iPhones , numerous anecdotes and secret information accompanied the iPhone 7 before its debut .
Elsewhere , many sources of information also claimed that the 3.5mm headphone jack will be removed from the new iPhone to be replaced by bluetooth connection and the charging interface . This will give Apple room for adding a second speaker .
Another piece of corroborative evidence is that as far back as 2014 , Apple had already allowed headphone manufacturers to connect headphone products through the charging interface .
The answer to such news , whether true or false , will only be revealed by Apple at the 2016 Fall launch event .
This did not stop industry insiders from taking a positive view of the prospects of iPhone 7 however . Many believed that iPhone 7 could very well be the last time Apple would significantly upgrade the iPhone series .
However , data recently published by IDC , a market intelligence firm , showed the market share of iPhone has decreased slightly .
Goldman Sachs has rated Apple shares as something that can be &quot; bought . &quot; BMO analysts believe that iPhone7 will establish a historical record in sales performance .
Broadcom CEO Hock Tan also expressed that Apple is expected to achieve more than 20 % growth in revenue . This figure can be completely attributed to the release of iPhone7 .
7 % of those interviewed said they intend to buy iPhone 7 compared to a mere 4 % who planned to buy iPhone 6 two years ago .
From information available , 20 % of users currently holding an iPhone6 or 6Plus have plans for purchasing iPhone7 . This proportion is quite substantial .
Next , experts analyzed that most Apple fans like to replace their iPhone every other generation .
Statistics revealed that among iPhone users , approximately 26 % of users have not changed their mobile phones in two years , i.e. , the iPhones of about 120 million users have been used for two years .
Some media reported that Taiwan has been hit by several earthquakes during the iPhone7 production period . &quot; Damages sustained by TSMC production facilities may have went beyond expectations , and that could have influenced initial supply for iPhone7 . &quot;
Supply and demand conflicts will influence normal users . It is time to select a proper channel and acquire an authentic iPhone7 early at a low price .
Insider disclosure revealed that the upper management of Suning and Apple has met frequently in recent times for the purpose of preparing enough resources .
Service operators have reached an agreement with Suning . It can be expected that with growing partnership between the two , users will be provided with lower prices and more dedicated services .
&quot; The lowest price . The customers might &apos; only RMB 7 a day to get a iPhone7 . &quot;
Sufficient supply of goods and a variety of discounts , buyers of iPhone 7 will not be so stressed out , and Suning &apos;s logistics department will all the more turn this happiness into a more intuitive experience .
Perhaps you will receive a phone call at midnight . &quot; Hello , this is Suning.com. Your iPhone 7 has arrived . &quot;

Foreign media reported that the Rio Olympics &quot; &quot; green pool &quot; incident has attracted much attention recently because of the change in the color of the water in the diving pool from blue to green .
However , on the morning of the 10th , the water in the water polo pool next to the diving pool also turned green .
An Australian water polo player said that he experienced stinging pain in his eyes after the competition and felt teary .
Officials of the Rio Olympics confirmed the pool water turning green , and expressed that the color change was a result of reduced alkalinity of the water and will not affect the physical health of the athletes .
However , athletes from the Australian team expressed that they felt stinging pain in their eyes after beating the Japanese team in the water polo pool .
At first , after the water in the diving pool turned green , the tournament organizer worked over time to address the issue of the diving pool on the night of the 9th , but on the morning of the 10th , the color of the water polo pool also turned green rapidly .
During the competition between the Australian and Japanese teams , conditions and environment of the water polo pool continued to worsen . However , officials emphasized that they will restore the two swimming pools to their original quality and color on the 11th .
Mario Andrada , the spokesman of Rio Olympic Games said : &quot; the alkaline level of the diving pool decreased from yesterday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; We learned about a number of factors that may cause the water to change in terms of color as well as water quality and alkalinity . &quot;
The water sports center performed a series of tests on water quality . Several hundred divers and swimmers who used the pool can also testify that the water quality has reached the required standards . &quot;
&quot; We have been operating according to normal procedures these days , but we may have neglected the impact that more athletes may have on the quality of water . &quot;
&quot; Although the color of the water has changed , it will definitely not affect one &apos;s health , especially as regards athletes . &quot;
&quot; This independent team verified our assessments and acknowledged the measures that we took to restore the swimming pool to its original color and normal chemical state . &quot;
&quot; We had hoped that the pool would return to its normal color in the morning , but rain had affected the pace of restoration . &quot;

As of 8am , the prison authorities have yet to issue a detailed explanation , including how the prisoners obtained the hand grenades .
Yesterday , police force from central Philippines entered the Leyte district prison , shooting and killing a prison-mate who &quot; attempted to assault an officer . &quot;
Urumqi standardizes FIT market order ; travel agencies must sign contract with tourists
The peak season for travel in Xinjiang has arrived . For the purpose of standardizing the operating order of the FIT ( Free Independent Traveler ) market , the Urumqi tourism enforcement detachment joined forces with the City Transportation Authority enforcement detachment yesterday to investigate issues that exist in the FIT market such as non-compliant use of vehicles for travel , and the low rate of signed contracts between travel agencies and tourists .
At 8 AM in the morning of the previous day , about 10 large buses filled with tourists are parked around the Kempinski Hotel . Most of these buses are carrying visitors heading to the one-day tour to Tianchi Lake .
&quot; Hello , I am from the Urumqi Travel Bureau . Have you signed a contract with this travel agency ? &quot;
Yu Bin , a staff member of the enforcement section of the Urumqi Road Transportation Administration said : &quot; Tour vehicles from outside the region or route buses are not qualified to participate in developing tourism transportation projects in the Urumqi market . &quot;
&quot; The penalty for operating beyond scope is a fine of RMB30,000-100,000 . Drivers without a practitioner &apos;s certificate is a fine of RMB2,000 .
From our understanding , the Urumqi tourism law enforcement department is currently carrying out inspections to Xigongyuan , Hongshan , and other destinations frequented by independent tourists .
After reviewing conclusions of the two inspections , Ma Qi , vice captain of the Urumqi tourism law enforcement detachment , said : &quot; Safety is the priority , followed by legal compliance . These are extremely important for tourism vehicles , because once an accident happens , many would be injured or killed . &quot;
&quot; We are working with the Road Transportation Administration Bureau to continuously monitor the market and regulate tourism vehicle usage , to ensure tourist safety . &quot;
On the morning of August 12 , the State Council Information Office held a press conference on the operating conditions of the nation &apos;s economy in July 2016 .
Sheng Laiyun , National Bureau of Statistics Spokesman and Deputy Director-General of the Department of Comprehensive Statistics said that a number of national economic indicators grew at a slower rate in July but were still operating within a reasonable range .
Figures from the National Bureau of Statistics revealed that fixed asset investment growth , total imports and other data declined again in July .
Sheng Laiyun said , &quot; As far as the operating condition of the national economy in July is concerned , I would like to borrow a phrase from the Premier , and that is &quot; fluctuations exist but the trend remains positive . &quot; This can better encapsulate the characteristics of the economy in July . &quot;
He explained that &quot; fluctuations exist in the trend &quot; refers to the fact that the growth rates of some of the July economic indicators have indeed declined .
The pressure on exporting sector is still huge due to the drastic adjustment of domestic and international economy in July , profound change of international situation and the world economic recovery failed the expectation .
Domestically , the entire economy is still going through adjustments , and some adverse reactions to this adjustment have surfaced . Some indicators may fluctuate as the economy faces significant downward pressure .
Sheng Laiyun pointed out the occurrence of extraordinary events in July : floods were worse than usual , and the hot weather and high temperatures affected production and the operations of some regions .
Latest information released by the Ministry of Civil Affairs showed that the disaster has affected over 60 million people and led to a direct economic loss of over 200 billion RMB .
These regions have been affected to varying degrees based on relevant industrial , investment and transportation indicators .
The growth in inventory turnover volume in July dropped 3.6 % compared to last month . The flooding disaster has imposed a certain degree of influence to traffic in these areas .
These factors show that volatility in some of the indicators in July is normal and within expectations .
He said that the &quot; trend is still positive &quot; meant that although economic growth has decelerated , the economy was running steadily on the whole . The general trend of improvement amid stability and growing positively amid stability remained unchanged .
CPI rose by 1.8 % in July , and grew by 0.2 % when compared to the previous period . CPI from January to July rose by 2.1 % . These figures indicate that trends for commodity prices have , in general , remained steady .
Statistics on high temperature days of various districts provided on portal website of the Chongqing City Meteorological Administration said that with the exception of Youyang County , every area in the city could receive varying amounts of high temperature subsidies .
Currently , at least 28 provinces in the country have clarified their subsidy disbursement criteria , but the disbursement criteria differs among provinces . In Chongqing , high-temperature subsidy is received based on subsidy for high-temperature working days .
At temperatures equal or more than 35 ℃ and less than 37 ℃ , each person shall be given a fee of not less than RMB10 per day . At temperatures higher than 37 ℃ , each person shall be given a fee of not less than RMB15 per day .
Workers working at above a temperature of 40 ℃ can receive a monthly subsidy of up to 20 RMB per day ( this does not apply to a worker who is already provided with a high temperature operation subsidy according to law ) .
According to this criteria , Kaizhou , which experienced the most number of high-temperature days last month would receive RMB330 , while Chengkou which experienced the least number of days would received RMB80 . As the highest temperature in Youyang did not exceed the high temperature benchmark , it did not receive any high-temperature subsidy .
In the past , many companies often use cooling and refreshing beverages to offset the high temperature subsidy . The city administration of work safety , however , expressed that this act is not compliant to the current laws .
Employers may not deduct or reduce the salary of laborers if work has to be suspended or work time reduced due to high temperatures .
The municipal human resources and social security bureau said that workers who worked under high temperatures without receiving high temperature allowance may fight for their legal rights by way of the labor dispute mediation mechanism , or call 12333 to file a complaint .
In case employer refuse to pay high-temperature allowance , employee is entitled to complain to the local administrative authority of HR and social security at the county level .
Also , since the high temperature subsidy is considered part of the salary and not a benefit , it is included in total salary and subject to the personal income tax .
High temperature subsidies are not included considered part of the minimum wage and must be issued in the form of cash . They cannot be replaced in the form of beverages or other tangible items .

Gracia is a cute female toucan with the scent of the jungle about her .
In the Central American country of Costa Rica , the toucan Gracia and its story are extremely well-known .
The August 10 press conference finally revealed Gracia after recovering from the operation , displaying its brand new 3D-printed plastic beak .
This toucan whose upper beak was broken by someone , and which was on the brink of death , has now finally received a new lease of life .
This is the day that the bird has reached 100 % recovery and the day when it could be moved to a luxurious bird house and meet its human friends who have been caring for it .
Gracia appears to be rather shy after moving to her new home , but quickly revealed her lively side , playing in the pool of water and using her new beak to eat grapes .
To remind people of the abuse it once suffered , the technicians did not color its new beak , but kept it white , the original color of the 3D printing material .
The external layer of the beak is a thin keratin sheath . The beak is hollow and only reinforced by thin , criss-crossing supporting struts of bone .
Although reinforced internally , the toucan &apos;s beak is still fragile , and will crack when it is harmed .
The animal aid center , an ornithologist , and a 3D printing company from the United States are working together , making several &quot; experimental beaks &quot; for Gracia before creating the &quot; perfect beak &quot; that best suits the bird .
Now Gracia has become proficient in using her beak to drink , eat , and even pick up fine seed grains .
&quot; The design of the final product took about two months ; printing took just four to five hours . &quot;
&quot; 3D printing is not for next generation . It has become part of our life . &quot; Thomas Lange , President of SG3D told the Xinhua News Agency .
On January 2015 , Gracia the toucan was found , bleeding from its mouth , by a person in a farm at Gracia , Alajuela Province in central Costa Rica .
At the time , its upper beak was cruelly broken by a group of youths . It could not eat and was dying .
Once reported in mass media , Gracia &apos;s sad state initiated a wave of outcry against animal abuse in and outside Costa Rica .
The public requested more rigorous animal protection laws to be established , and punishment for abusers to be stepped out .
People came forward voluntarily , and did the best they could to help Grecia regain its life prior to the injury .
Even Chuck Hull , the inventor of 3D printing technology , also contributed towards the design of Gracia &apos;s upper beak .
&quot; Gracia &apos;s condition is quite unique . Less than 1 cm of its upper beak has remained , making it difficult to install a new beak . &quot;
&quot; We first scanned Gracia and then designed and manufactured an extended prosthetic that is slightly longer than its remaining upper beak . The prosthetic is then glued to its upper beak . &quot;
&quot; This will help reduce further invasive injury on Grecia , &quot; Lange told a XInhua international news reporter .
Prior to installing the prosthetics , workers cleaned the broken beak for Gracia everyday to prevent infections .
Thousands of miles away , the story of Gracia the toucan has moved renowned documentary filmmaker Paula Heredia and investigative journalist John Hoffman .
Toucan Nation is a documentary that recorded in detail the process of fitting a new beak for Grecia , which was broadcast on Animal Planet this month .
The documentary Toucan Nation showed how a small toucan bird could change a country and encourage every citizen to participate in the movement against animal abuse .
Key reminder : Japan &apos;s oil enterprises are wary of the rise of small independent oil refineries in China referred to as &quot; teapots . &quot;
An August 12 report by cankaoxiaoxi.com revealed that Japan &apos;s biggest oil enterprise JX Energy believed that , &quot; Rising Chinese exports is one of the reasons for the sluggish market conditions . &quot;
Japanese oil companies are particularly wary of the rise of small independent oil refineries in China referred to as &quot; teapots . &quot;
As the Chinese government has stepped up environmental protection laws , the quality of petroleum products of China is now approaching those of Japan .
Before gaining crude oil import permits , &quot; teapot refineries &quot; typically import crude oil from Russia and other places with higher sulfur content for refining .
The petroleum products produced have higher sulfur content , and are of poor quality . They are a contributing factor to environmental pollution .
Upon receiving crude oil import permits , &quot; teapot refineries &quot; are allowed to import crude oil with lower sulfur content from Oman and Russia . The quality of their petroleum products has also improved .
TonenGeneral Group expressed that : &quot; As quality standards for petroleum products from China continue to increase , improvements were also observed for the capacities of its oil refining facilities .
As a result , the quality of petroleum products exported from China is gradually reaching parity with those from Japan . &quot;
JX said that since &quot; China started exporting high-quality light oil to Australia from the end of 2015 , &quot; the nation has become a competitor of Japan in the Asian market .
Although &quot; high quality oil from Japan &quot; is facing a crisis , the response strategy adopted by Japanese oil companies is limited to &quot; focusing on market situations and exporting to areas where a profit may be made . &quot;
As the petroleum products exported by China has an enormous impact on Asian market conditions , the focus on teapot refineries have also increased .

UV not only darkens the skin , it will also cause sunburns . Is there any solution to help the skin make it through military training and avoid sunburns altogether ?
The external packaging of sunblock cream is often labeled with SPF and PA . SPF refers to the sun protection factor and specifically targets UVB radiation . Common SPF scores include 15 , 30 , and 50 .
Products with the PA label are aimed at UVA . Such sunblocks are more effective . Generally , the strength of PA is indicated by the + sign . Each additional + represents a longer duration of effective protection .
For oily skin , choose aqueous sunblock with good penetrability . Sunblock sprays are good options as well .
For dry skin , use cream-based anti-sunburn products . Those with neutral skin are not subject to stringent regulations . However , sensitive skin will find application of any product to be a hard burden . Purely physical sunblock products are recommended .
Remember to apply the sunblock cream half an hour earlier as the anti-sunburn product needs some time before completely penetrating the skin .
Military training includes extended exposure to solar radiation . Anti-sunburn cream must be applied once every 2 hours to sustain the effects . Don &apos;t get lazy about this .
Since the skin has just been sensitized by exposure to the sun , do not use whitening products immediately after military training .
For sunburns endured during military training , ice wrapped in towels can be used to cool scorched skin and alleviate local senses of over-heating .
The policy of cumulative subsidies will continue to be implemented for farmers who purchased agricultural equipment during the expo . Farmers who purchased agricultural equipment may receive a maximum of 40 % in subsidies .

The exhibit for this year will strive to sign agreements for 60 projects , introduce 22.0 billion RMB of investments , and sign at least 160 trade contracts for a contractual sum of 3.2 billion RMB .
From what we know , the reason the Hunan Expo has been held at the city of Loudi in Hunan for seven consecutive years was related to its strong manufacturing base , and its long history in industrial development .
As the main hosting venue for the Hunan Expo , Loudi has established trade relations with over 90 countries from around the world .
The &quot; Hunan Expo &quot; has become an important platform for the Province in terms of nurturing the development of specialty industries , and propelling specialty industries to go abroad .
The ionosphere is filled with free electrons on some nights , which implies that radio signals can travel further .
According to a August 11 online report published by Popular Science , an American monthly journal , the US Air Force is interested in duplicating this effect .
Although an ionosphere and its vast reserve of free electrons can help people receive the radio broadcast from a certain university base station , this was probably not the interest of the US Air Force .
An ionosphere filled with electrons will provide military radios with a larger range of delivery and offer a certain degree of protection against the influence of solar storms for global positioning system ( GPS ) signals .
The final objective is to create a series of three-dimensional satellites as required . These would be able to enhance the ionosphere when required .
But first , the teams that have signed a contract with the Air Force must prove that the relevant scientific principles actually work .
Industry figures revealed that in 2015 , coal production capacity totaled approximately 6 billion tonnes , with excess capacity of 1.8 billion tonnes nationwide .
For nearly 10 years , the State Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China have announced 5 notices for eliminating redundant and obsolete production capacities .
Although the coal industry was not the target in the first four times , the targeted industries were directly related to coal industry production .
From November last year to January this year , the Qinhuangdao 5,500 kcal steam coal has been fluctuating around a price of 370 Yuan / ton , and 90 % of coal industries are experiencing losses .
Since February , coal prices have started to rebound . The price of steam coal at Qinhuangdao has risen for 4 consecutive weeks , reaching a peak during the last 16 months at a price of 436 Yuan per ton , a figure that almost rose by 70 Yuan compared to the start of the year .
As prices rebound , concerns have arisen : Will some of the small coal mines resume production ?
Kuang Xianming , director of the China Institute for Reform and Development ( Hainan ) , analyzed and interpreted this .
Kuang Xianming : Elimination of excess capacity caught everyone &apos;s attention . The report card on the elimination of excess capacity in the coal industry announced today has indeed caused greater concern .
These three superficial factors still reflect the lag in the change in our growth model , i.e. , the government driven growth model has yet to experience a fundamental change to date .
Second , it is directly related to the advance effort exerted by the local government . Cutting industrial overcapacity requires proper supportive measures which are varied in different places .
Third , if some of the provinces which are currently progressing at a slower rate expect to catch up in the second half , they would face bigger risks .
Under such straits , reliance on rewards and compensations from the central government to further increase production capacity will generate a certain degree of negative impact .
First , removing production capacity is not simply controlling total volume .
Our aim is to get rid of obsolete production capacity , achieve structural optimization , and re-organize the coal industry into a new business form .
The local government , during the deployment of overcapacity cutting , shall combine the effort with the transformation of coal industry to drive the development of related service sector .
Secondly , to complete the task of reducing production capacities this year , we must ensure thorough enforcement of our administrative supervision and administrative monitoring capacities .
Finally , we must strengthen miscellaneous provisions and functions of social programs .
As the market is directly related to employment issues , we must strengthen employable skill training for the employees and vocational workers .
&quot; The fall in ranking was because foreign investors have downgraded Brazil &apos;s medium- to long-term GDP growth forecast . &quot;
In 2015 , Brazil &apos;s participation rate in global fixed investment was 3.7 % , lower than the 5.7 % in 2014 .
Credit Suisse &apos;s international investment attractiveness index includes four sub-indices : infrastructure , economic outlook , business environment and volume of direct investment .
In 2015 , Brazil &apos;s foreign direct investment amounted to US $ 64.6 billion , lower than the US $ 73.1 billion in 2014 .
Last year , Brazil &apos;s &quot; Green Field Investment &quot; ( scale of investment in overseas facilities ) amounted to 17.9 billion USD , which was a 2.1 % reduction compared to the same period last year .
&quot; There is a total of 288 &quot; Green Field Investment &quot; projects in Brazil . From 2003 to 2014 , the annual average was 314 such projects . &quot;
However , in the first half of 2016 , foreign direct investments in Brazil reached 33.8 billion USD , an increase of nearly 10 % compared to the same period last year .
Original title : Canadian police shoots and skills IS supporter at final stage of creating home-made explosives for attacking the city area
Taxi companies expressed that this taxi was assigned to Driver &apos;s home before the police has arrived .
Canadian police expressed at the press conference on Wednesday that it had received information , including a &quot; martyrdom video &quot; provided by the Federal Bureau of Investigation that this youth was about to launch an attack .
According to Deutsche Welle , a man wearing a black balaclava in the video cited the Quran , mentioned the crimes committed against Muslims , and swore to initiate an attack against a Canadian city .
He expressed in a video that the ambush will initiate in 72 hours during peak traffic .
This is the first time that the police has killed a suspected terrorist before the terrorist attack after the Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau assumed his office last year .
The upgraded and reconstructed tributary navigation channels of the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal , namely Laowanfu River and Beidaliu navigation channels , have started to collect a toll on September 1 .
The two branch navigation routes will be constructed by means of social financing . The funds have been approved by relevant departments of the provincial government .
The navigation channel of Laowanfu River has a total length of 32.5 km , flowing through Jinxiang and Yutai before entering , via Nanyang Lake , the Grand Canal ( Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal ) .
Based on navigational requirements , the Laowanfu River channel has adopted a method of maintenance and reconstruction , having partially dredged the riverbed to increase its depth , and partially straightening sharp bends in the river , among others . Conditions of the shipping channel have improved .
This navigation channel has a total length of 19 km , flowing through Jinxiang County , Rencheng District , and entering , via Nanyang Lake , the Grand Canal .
Constructions to renovate the two navigational channels began in February 2011 , and were completed in January 2015 for inspections . The Jining City Anping Canal Logistic Service Center is the primary investor and operator of the channels .
According to the &quot; Build by loan , Charge to repay &quot; principle , Anping Canal Logistic Service Center will charge the passage toll according to the rated approved by Shandong Price Bureau .
Of which , a basic transportation fee is charged at 1.75 RMB / ton carried . Mileage transportation fee is charged at 0.05 RMB / km for each ton carried .
Toll collection hours will begin on June 15 , 2016 and end on June 14 , 2019 .
From the Jining Maritime and Port Bureau , the reporter learned that there are 4 paid navigation channels within Jining , namely Zhushui River , Baima River , Beidaliu , and Laowanfu River navigation channels .
The four shipping lanes are tributary channels of the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal , and were upgraded and reconstructed by way of public financing .
The project for upgrading and reconstructing the Zhushui River navigation channel is a first time attempt to use a &quot; government + market &quot; model . The project is an infrastructure undertaking for river ports in Shandong Province , with the government being the main investor while social investments make up for the gap in funding required .
Baima River , Laowanfu River , Beidaliu River and other tributary navigational channels have adopted a pure market-based operating approach .
The funds provided by the national budget could not satisfy construction costs , limiting the progress for navigation route upgrades .
Social capital used for constructing public infrastructure is compliant to national policy requirements , and has become a means to resolve the capital bottleneck .
Ning Zetao &apos;s performance during the 100-meter freestyle semi-finals has left many Chinese viewers speechless .
Again , Ning Zetao dropped the jaw of everyone during the 50m freestyle in the heats .
In fact , the 50-meter freestyle was not Ning Zetao &apos;s dominant event . His performance and best result at the Kazan FINA World Championships have also meant that the possibility of getting a breakthrough in this event is quite small .
As expected , Takungpao , a renowned Hong Kong news company , disclosed that the biggest reason behind Ning Zetao &apos;s defeat was that he had already lost interest in swimming .
Many external factors could play a significant role in his thoughts about the future . At this time , he is probably more interested in the entertainment business .
After the Kazan FINA World Championships , Ning Zetao became an instant Internet celebrity because of his good looks and good performance .
He was therefore tagged with the labels of &quot; public husband , &quot; &quot; young hunk , &quot; &quot; flowery boy , &quot; and other similar monikers .
Various commercial opportunities have arrived , providing great economic prospects for building a bustling boulevard .
Under these circumstances , even if Ning Zetao chooses to retire and join the entertainment business , not only is this his own choice , it is also a feasible option .
He is just 23 after all . With a bit of training , he will definitely be able to act in a couple of TV dramas based on his popularity .
Ning Zetao must make sure that he is qualified enough to be considered an equal to his predecessors .
For the 2000 Sydney Olympics , Liu Xuan , who was 21 years old by that time , has arrived at the end of her athletic carrier .
Liu Xuan &apos;s attractive appearance quickly made a impression with the people , and also served as the basis for her entry in the entertainment industry .
After retiring , Liu Xuan appeared in many television drama series and even established her own studio in 2013 .
Tian Liang participated in the men &apos;s single and synchronized 10 meter platform competition , winning 2 gold and 2 silver medals .
After losing to Hu Jia , a fellow team mate , for the single 10 meter platform in the 2004 Olympics , Tian Liang &apos;s athletic competitiveness deteriorated , and it was heard that he was expelled from the diving team .
He and his daughter participated in variety shows such as &quot; Where Are We Going , Dad ? &quot; which provided with him with a great deal of celebrity attention .
Yang Wei , Li Xiaopeng and Chen Yibing , once part of the golden era of gymnastics , have taken to various variety shows in a high profile manner .
It is worth mentioning that Yang Wei and Li Xiaopeng led China to the 2008 Olympic men &apos;s team championship . Yang Wei even won the individual all-around gold twice , and was named All-around King .
Chen Yibing , who led the Chinese gymnastics team to an Olympic gold in 2012 also became known as the king of rings .
After a controversial officiating decision at the London Olympics cost him a gold medal , Chen Yibing &apos;s magnanimity won him legions of fans .
However , the main focus of these athletes remains firmly on the competition at this time . Appearances at variety programs are just superficial .
Both former or current athletes must at least provide impressive performance in their field to gain the attention of the entertainment industry .
After all , athletes enter a new field , and everything is blank , be it skill or connection .
For &quot; older athletes &quot; such as Tian Liang and Liu Xuan who frequent the celebrity circles , the general public largely remember them for their performance in the Olympics .
When Yang Wei , Li Xiaopeng and other newcomers are introduced at variety programs , &quot; Olympic champion &quot; is mentioned without exception .
When compared to the other athletes mentioned , Ning Zetao &apos;s champion in the FINA World Championships seems somewhat less impressive in comparison .
When compared to Tian Liang , Liu Xuan , and Yang Wei who were able to retire after attaining glorious moments in history , if Ning Zetao were to retreat at the age of 23 after meeting a minor setback , the negative impact to his image would be quite significant .
When talking about athletes , the public requirement is that &quot; constant victory is not necessary , but they should not fear difficulties . &quot; Ning Zetao is found quite wanting in terms of this .
On the other hand , given his dashing looks , Ning Zetao could rely on his handsome features and win support from tens of thousands of superficial fans .
Lack of skill , and relying on appearance alone - if you want to make it big in the entertainment business , this should not be more difficult than getting proper training and rediscovering the form you ought to have .
Ultimately , personal journey is based upon personal will . Ning Zetao should be aware how this choice is made .
On the surface , social networking platforms have widened the social circle and reduced loneliness .
The scope of influence of online social networking has become increasingly widespread . Not only has it gradually replaced traditional phone communication , it has even permeated actual offline living circles , quietly changing the social activities of the masses .
The benefit of online social networking is obvious . It is easy and convenient , and is therefore much preferred by younger demographics .
A survey investigating college student socializing habits found that 57 % of college students spend more than 5 hours a day on cellphones , literally making cellphones &quot; inseparable &quot; during everyday lives .
&quot; The characteristics of social networks include being low-cost , having fast transmission rates , and allowing many people to interact simultaneously . This suits the needs of contemporary university students .
Expanded relationship circles , being able to chat on equal footing , and avoidance of social stigma are the main reasons why we become increasingly fond of online chat .
The newcomers enjoy online communication with other employees , &quot; because we are not familiar with each other at the beginning . But the &apos; like &apos; and comment in the social media will close the distance . &quot;
People who enjoy making friends also used online networking . &quot; I haven &apos;t been contacting a friend for a while due to some misunderstanding . We then shared a few words in a larger group and things got better from there . &quot;
IT engineer Wu Yan is strong fan for social networking , and spends most of his socializing time and life online , with many more online contacts than friends he meet offline .
Wu Yan himself honestly said that he feels like &quot; fish returned to the water &quot; when he goes online .
&quot; You may reply to a friend when you are willing at a time that is convenient for you to do so because there is plenty of time for you to deliberate the wordings , and you can also express yourself more clearly . &quot;
&quot; The ID provides one with a cover to avoid all face-to-face interpersonal conflicts , providing one with more room to maneuver and also provided both sides with more time and space to think about what they say . &quot;
&quot; People of different status are given the same rights to speech and the same voice . Various social taboos in real life seem to disappear in the online world . &quot;
Xiaopeng , a friend of Wu Yan , felt that the real life Wu Yan is a &quot; boring geek . &quot;
Xiaopeng and Wu Yan met in a big group . As they were both active speakers , they became acquainted very quickly .
Xiaopeng felt that Wu Yan was completely different from his online personality . The real Wu Yan used little words and never gave any opinions . The only phrases he would use were : &quot; Ho ho . Alright . Really ? &quot; or &quot; I &apos;ll check that online . &quot;
The police forces of Lingshui have joined in the investigation . Lingshui traffic departments will also strengthen measures to correct issues regarding illegally operating business vehicles .
&quot; The outcome of a police investigation into the August 4 conflict is still pending . Just after midnight on August 11 , the homes of another two taxi drivers were wrecked . &quot;
&quot; Trishaws operate illegally mostly during the night these days . We hope that the governing departments can also intensify their efforts to remedy the situation . &quot;
A reporter of Hinews learned from the Lingshui Li Autonomous County Police Department that the police is currently handling two reports . Further investigations are being carried out for the motive and responsible individuals behind the two cases as well as the relationships between them .
Wang Wenyi , traffic management station master of Lingshui Transport Bureau , said that Lingshui Transport Department has set out to deal with trishaws that transport passengers illegally since the beginning of this year , and has outlawed a total of 613 illegal passenger trishaws .
In the next step , the transportation department will submit applications to the county government , working with multiple departments to step up enforcements to reorganize tricycles , motorcycles , unlicensed commercial vehicles , and other illegal business vehicles throughout the entire county .
At 8 : 00 AM of August 11 , the reporter of Qilu Evening News followed the volunteer health consultation team of &quot; Healthy China Tour &quot; and arrived at Hegou Village in Xihu County , Donggang District .
The village , approximately 24 km from the city , is remotely situated . There are more than 200 households living in the village . Limited by economic , transport and physical factors , middle aged and elderly patients find it inconvenient to visit the doctor .
The scope of this volunteer medical consultation service is quite thorough , and includes internal medicine , surgery , pneumology , psychiatry , dermatology , and pediatric departments .
Many villages heard that volunteer health care specialists would be visiting , and began waiting at the small village square very early on .
Mdm Xue , who is 67 years old this year , suffers from congenital scoliosis . She also recently experienced the issues caused by asthma , and would often pant and find herself short of breath when climbing slopes .
The doctor told Aunty Xue that there is little possibility of a cure for chronic bronchitis , but regular and determined medical treatment can provide relief .
An elderly lady in her sixties brought her little grandchild for consultation at the clinic of the dermatologist .
The old man &apos;s youngest grandson is 11 years old . Since the boy was 3 , he has been chronically affected by &quot; jiaoqi &quot; on his left foot .
After checking the legs , the doctor told the elderly that the issue was not &quot; jiaoqi &quot; ( athlete &apos;s foot ) but seasonal dermatitis , and gave the reminder to stop using non-prescription drugs and avoid delaying proper treatment .
&quot; We provided medical treatment and B-scan ultrasonography services in this village , while another team of volunteer doctors also provided free medical examination services at Qiujiadianzi Village , Hubu Township , Wulian County . &quot;
This round of volunteer medical consultation service is only part of the Healthy China Tour . Other activities will be implemented accordingly in the future . &quot;
51Talk is believed to have landmark significance in the area of building an online education industry ecosphere .
CEO Huang Jiajia expressed that their strategy for the next 5 years is to provide the world &apos;s best learning materials to the children in China .
According to information , &quot; The biggest advantage of 51Talk lies in its ability to cater to the different requirements of users of different age groups .
Chief Operating Officer Zhang Liming said however that by linking global quality foreign teachers and services with students , parents will no longer have to tire themselves and waste precious time picking up and dropping off their children .

Relevant institutions shall , within six months of the date of notification , cease , in an orderly manner , to carry out relevant payment services as requested .
Bank of China will continue to prudently carry out work concerned with the renewal of the License for Payment Services according to the law .
Consecutive earthquakes registering 4.4 and 4.5 on the Richter scale has occurred at the Tibetan County of Nima , no has been hurt or killed
Local civil affairs departments reported that no casualty has been caused . The severity and damages caused by the disaster is currently being calculated and verified .
Chang Yubo , the deputy director of the Disabled Persons &quot; Federation of the city , attended the event and gave an important address .
Leaders who were present presented an award to the second &quot; Loving Yuanshan &quot; Lei Feng private fleet of vehicles .
For over 20 years , the &quot; Loving Yuanshan &quot; project has employed actual actions to provide charitable services to the entire society . Yuanshan Forest Farm has received and managed 5 business units in difficult straits , helping to resettle nearly a thousand employees in the process .
When experiencing a major disaster , the people of Yuanshan will organize themselves to donate money and items , providing a helpful hand to the society .
The spirit of Leifeng is the symbol of truth , rightness and beauty of our ear , a long-term course fitting in socialist values , said Mr. Sun Jianbo , the Finalist Winner of National Moral Model and former Secretary of Party Committee of Shan LinChang .
When the ceremony ended , the participants of the event visited the Shandong Yuanshan Pioneers &quot; Memorial Hall to experience its barrier-free facilities .
At the teachers &quot; training site , Mayor of Rivas Wilfredo Lopez said that all Nicaraguan government entities are working together with HKND to jointly advance the environmental management program , and to embark on afforestation activities .
As the canal developer , HKND Group continued to observe international best practice , and constructed the canal according to international standards , protecting Nicaragua &apos;s ecological environment as much as possible . &quot;
University students , by combining theory and practice , led secondary and primary school students to plant trees , teaching the next generation of Nicaraguans about afforestation and how to go green .
National Agrarian University ( Nicaragua ) Faculty of Natural Resources and Environment Professor Francisco Reyes led a team to participate in an afforestation education project .
We have reasons to believe that the transoceanic canal project led by the HKND Group will benefit the people of Nicaragua immensely and provide more employment opportunities in the region . &quot;
To ensure long-term benefits of tree planting and reforestation programs , HKND Group also released an illustrated book with tree planting and reforestation training that was given to 15,000 junior-high and elementary school students of Rivas . The aim is to provide students , teachers , and parents with long-term technical guidance .
Recently , the 10th China International Folk Art Festival organized by the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Qinghai People &apos;s Government celebrated its opening ceremony at Xining in Qinghai .
Approximately 300 artists from art troupes and ensembles in 13 countries and regions across five continents gathered together to present exciting performances with international and ethnic and folk characteristics to the audience .
Tajikistan &apos;s &quot; Avesta &quot; news agency , citing information from the Tajik central bank , claimed that Tajikistan &apos;s inflation was 3.7 % for the first seven months of this year .
The report pointed out that inflation in Tajikistan was 3.7 % in the first seven months of this year . In particular , inflation in the month of July was 0.6 % , while inflation for the most recent year was 6 % .
The report said that the aim of the Tajik government is to maintain annual inflation rate within 7.5 % in 2016 . In 2015 , the inflation rate of Tajikistan was 5.1 % .
Reports further pointed out that for economic development and inflation issues faced by Tajikistan in 2016 , the Tajik government and a number of major international financial institutions made different predictions in these areas .
Tajikistan &apos;s Ministry of Economic Development and Trade forecast that the nation &apos;s economic growth would reach 7 % in 2016 , while inflation would also be above this level in general .
On the other hand , the Asia Development Bank , the World Bank , and the International Monetary Fund respectively gave different predictions for economic development and inflation of Tajikistan in 2016 .
As regards these two indicators , forecasts by the Asian Development Bank was 4.2 % and 7 % ; the World Bank &apos;s was 4.8 % and 7.5 % ; and that of the International Monetary Fund at 3.4 % and 8.2 % .
From our understanding , although affected by a series of negative external factors that include poor global economy , depreciation of the Russian ruble , and reducing foreign remittance , the Tajik economy managed to achieve a 6 % growth in 2015 .
On August 11 , when the reporter &apos;s telephone interview reached Huang Yilin who has returned to her home at Jinyang in Sichuan , she said : &quot; It was an emergency . The only thing I could think of is to rescue people . &quot;
Huang Yiling is a student of the 2015 cohort of the Landscape Architecture School in the Central South University Forestry and Technology .
Huang Yilin who is now studying the professional field of town and country planning wishes to visit Langzhong in Sichuan to learn about architecture in that region , and thus took the entire family to a trip to that location .
At about 10 am on August 8 , Huang Yilin &apos;s father was resting at the hotel , while she and her mother were getting ready to wander about Langzhong Ancient City .
After walking for a short distance , they saw a small crowd screaming and yelling , and approached them out of curiosity .
Seeing that the &quot; little boy has disappeared and that the little girl is splashing around in the water , with her head bobbing up and down the river water as the water keeps dragging her down , &quot; Huang Yilin , who had learned swimming at a young age , jumped into the water to save the child .
After jumping into the river , 165-meter tall Huang Yilin realized she could not find the bottom !
The water surface which seemed serene previously hid powerful currents underneath .
But she did everything she could to swim toward the little girl .
Huang Yilin said that the river was muddy and rapid . She was almost spent swimming a distance of less than 5 meters .
She used her entire strength to push the little girl to the side of the levee . &quot; The slope is so slipper . I thought I might sink when I run out of power . &quot;
Huang Yilin therefore cried out to her mother for help . Upon hearing her daughter &apos;s cries , Mdm Yin , who was not a good swimmer , decided to go into the water but was stopped by other swimmers .
On August 10 , after the story of Huang Yilin leaping into the river to save a girl spread , Mdm Yin received plenty of words of comfort and praise from family members and friends , as well as &quot; blame &quot; from many .
&quot; I still feel the linger fear ! To tell you the truth , my heart was broken when the kid almost fading on the bank cried out for help .
Fear still lingered in Mdm Yin &apos;s heart . Despite the dangers , Mdm Yin said that she would still support the choice made by her daughter under such circumstances and felt proud for what she did .
Huang Yilin seldom took the initiative to go swimming after she learned the skill because she was forced into it . &quot; Who would have thought it would come in handy . &quot;
According to Huang Yilin &apos;s class monitor Chen Yiyang , the class has long regarded Huang Yilin as the &quot; top-scoring student &quot; and knew that she is willing to help others .
Opening Ceremony on the 13th for the first Youth Games of Yunnan Province to display ethnic and youth energies
Yunnan Province &apos;s inaugural Youth Games will be held in Mangshi , Dehong Prefecture , from August 13 to August 22 .

With effect from September 1 , senior citizens aged 60 to 64 may pay 50 % less when riding on a city bus .
In the morning of the 11th , several senior citizens were queuing before the IC card sales center of Jining Public Transport Company to apply for the card . Mr. Yao , a 62-year old citizen , received a half-price pass for senior citizens .
In the past , the Aging Problem Commission , Finance Bureau , and Transportation Bureau of Jining City released Notice for Half-Price Urban Bus Fares for Senior Citizens 60-64 Years of Age . This welfare policy was formally enforced on September 1 this year .
&quot; Senior citizens who meet the conditions can simply bring their second generation identity card to an IC sales center to apply for the item . Senior citizens with household registration outside the city who meet the age criteria can also enjoy this benefit . &quot;
Liu Xia , deputy director of the Computer Center of Jining Public Transport Company , said that since it was first released on August 1 , the company has processed over 200 half-price fair tickets for senior citizens .
Currently , two types of senior citizen cards are offered . One is a free pass for senior citizens , while the other is a half-price pass for senior citizens .
&quot; For the convenience of the elderly , we have upgraded our system . The frequency of audit for the free card for the elderly has been cut from twice a year to once a year , so that elderly cardholders do not have to bring it in twice . &quot;
China Securities Regulatory Commission ( CSRC ) indicated on its official weibo today that the two securities regulators are currently working closely together with the Shenzhen Stock Exchange and the Shanghai Stock Exchange .
Meanwhile , the CSRC formed a &quot; Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect &quot; special task force to actively advance the various preparatory work related to the &quot; Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect . &quot; When the relevant regulatory provisions and technical equipment are ready , it will commence operations at an opportune moment this year .
When mass SMS fraud reaches a certain number , even if the fraud was unsuccessful , one may be found guilty of committing fraud .
Proceedings by the People &apos;s Court of Wolong District in Nanyang City of Henan Province found that the accused , Li Huiwang , used a fake base station device to send fraudulent messages at Tongbo County and Nanyang City areas from September 30 to October 4 , 2015 .
In the same year , at around 10 on October 5 , the defendant checked into a room in a hotel at Wolong district , Nanyang City , and used a fake base station to commit mass SMS fraud . He was arrested by Public Security officers .
According to assessments , the fake base station sent a total of 62,228 message notifications on October 4 , 2015 , interrupting communications for 62,228 cellphone users for a period ranging from 8 seconds to 10 minutes .
After reviewing the case , the court believes that the defendant Li Huiwang used a fake base station to send a total of 62,228 fraudulent messages to an unspecified but large number of people , an act that has established the criminal act of fraud .
As the defense attorney said that the defendant did not attempt the crime or caused the crime to occur , and exhibited a positive attitude when pleading guilty , the attorney recommended adopting a lighter punishment .
Taking into consideration the criminal nature of the defendant , his attitude toward admission of guilt and other circumstances , he was sentenced to four years and six months in prison and fined 10,000 yuan for committing fraud .
The Siberian tiger is now listed as an endangered ( EN ) species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) Red List .
According to the Forestry Department of Jilin , the 1998 data from a joint monitoring exercise by China , the US and Russia showed that there were only four to six Siberian tigers , and three to five Amur leopards living in the wild in Jilin Province .
According to Yu Changchun , director of the conservation section of the Jilin Forestry Department , said that Jilin Province has been expanding protection efforts for the wildlife . The populations of the northeastern tiger and northeastern leopard have achieved significant growth and their ranges have been growing as well .
Data from the latest monitoring in 2015 revealed that 27 Siberian tigers and 42 Amur leopards living in the wild were detected within Jilin Province .
As flagship species of World Animal Protection distributed across the China-Russia border , the China-Russia partnership is especially meaningful to restore and increase the populations of northeastern tigers and leopards .
According to the Department of Forestry of Jilin , the province has established a long-term and stable system of cooperation and exchange .
During the 2016 International Conference for the Conservation of Hunchun Tigers and Leopards of China that concluded on the 11th , forestry agencies and animal protection groups of China and Russia have once again reached multiple consensus .
The Jilin Forestry Department expressed that strengthening the conversation partnership between China and Russia is a desperate task for protecting the northeastern tigers and leopards of China . It is also imperative in maintaining the health of Russian tiger and leopard populations .
As a leading cadre of the Party , Sun Fujian lost his ideal and conviction , and severely violated Party discipline . He failed to restrain himself , refused to stop committing errors , opposed Party conduct , and violated Party discipline even after the 18th National Party Congress , the very nature of which was contemptible , and the situation grave .
The case resulted in harmful social impact after becoming the spotlight in the media publication .
After the case occurred , leaders of the criminal police department of the Haikou public security bureau attached great importance to the matter , and immediately organized a team of elite police force to initiate the investigation .
The police immediately initiated an online manhunt for the suspect , deployed multiple measures , and contacted police forces in other areas to find out the whereabouts of Wang X. Guo .
As the suspect was a serial thief , and had been arrested and punished by the public security bureau , he had fairly strong anti-reconnaissance ability . Coupled with the fact that he was a drug addict , his addiction frequently occurred during questioning , making interrogation very difficult .
The Greenland Shark is also known as the small-headed sleeper shark , and is widely distributed in the Northern Atlantic around Greenland and Iceland . When fully-grown , the shark can reach a length of 4 to 5 meters .
The Greenland shark grows at a extremely slow rate , only 1 cm per year sometimes , suggesting a particularly long lifespan .
Traditional dating methods often use calcified tissues of animals . Fin spines may used in some sharks but this type of calcified tissue is extremely rare in Greenland sharks .
New research led by Julius Nielsen of Denmark &apos;s University of Copenhagen used the lens of the eyes of the Greenland shark to carry out radiocarbon dating .
This method has been used before to determine the age of a whale , but is used , for the first time , to determine the age of a shark and similar types of fish .
Their analysis indicated that the largest shark has an age of about 392 years , with a standard error of about 120 years .
This means that this shark is at least 272 years old , and could be as old as 512 years old .
A female Greenland Shark must reach a length of about 4 meters to reach reproductive maturity . When converted to actual age , she must be at least 156 years old before she is mature .
Researchers therefore included , within their paper , that the Greenland Shark is the currently-known longest-living vertebrate animal on Earth , surpassing the previous champion of right whales with a lifespan of 211 years .
Since a year ago , the results of the exchange rate reform have been significant . The RMB exchange rate has remained generally stable . The reform has also laid the foundation for advancing the internationalization of the RMB at the same time .
In terms of market performance , the RMB exchange rate &apos;s characteristic of fluctuating both ways is apparent . The exchange rate &apos;s elasticity has increased and is expected to remain generally stable .
To date , the exchange rate reform has seen the median price of the RMB : USD exchange rate repeatedly fluctuating at more than 100 basis points , with intermittent appreciation and depreciation .
The last exchange rate reform measures prior to the &quot; 8.11 &quot; exchange rate reform last year were implemented in 2005 . In the last 10 years , the RMB has appreciated significantly against the USD .
Since the new currency reforms , Renminbi reversed its appreciation and its central parity rate dropped by about 8 % within an year .
On October 1 this year , the International Monetary Fund will officially include the RMB as a currency in the SDR ( Special Drawing Rights ) basket .
Figures announced by the General Administration of Customs this week revealed that for the first seven months of this year , China &apos;s total imports and exports fell 3 % year-on-year to RMB13.21 trillion .
Also in July , the sum of export and import decreased only 0.9 % y-o-y , while export increased 2.9 % during the same time .
Some experts believe that although imports and exports in July exhibited signs of stability , overly optimistic expectations should be avoided .
In July , China &apos;s total import and export amounted to RMB2.09 trillion , down 0.9 % year-on-year .
In which exports amounted to 1.22 trillion RMB for a 2.9 % growth ; imports amounted to 873.0 billion RMB , decreasing by 5.7 % ; and trade surplus amounted to 342.8 billion RMB for a 34 % growth .
Although total imports and exports have decreased compared to the same period last year , data for export value has increased . This is the fifth consecutive month with growth in exports since March this year .
Shanghai Police arrested more than 3,400 individuals from 157 groups of &quot; thieves , robbers , and frauds &quot; in 4 months
While solving the case , the police also recovered illicit money and goods amounting to more than RMB33 million .
According the confessions of members of the gang of thieves , they entered Shanghai from other parts of the country by chartering an unlicensed taxi . They then separately disembarked to commit the crimes , and would meet up several hours later to leave Shanghai together in the vehicle .
When committing crime , a suspect often regards a building as a unit , climbs up via the external wall , breaks the fence , and steals &quot; floor by floor &quot; from top to bottom .
The suspect has been transferred to the Xuihui District Procuratorate by the Xuhui public security branch for review and prosecution .
The police reminded the public to lock the doors and windows of their homes properly before going out . As for the choice of burglar-proof windows , the public were advised to choose steel of a harder material .
According to Evening Peak News of Voice of China , Shinzō Abe , Prime Minister of Japan , will attend the Sixth Tokyo International Conference on African Development to be held in Kenya at the end of August .
The Conference of Africa &apos;s Development is organized by Japan . The first five sessions of this Conference were held in the Japanese cities of Tokyo or Yokohama . This will therefore be the first session of the Conference held in Africa .
As regards this , an official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan said that convening a conference locally in Africa helps attract the attention of African and European nations with regard to Japan .
To support Shinzo Abe &apos;s visit , reports from Kyodo News said that the Liberal Democratic Party of Japan will be sending representative delegations to various countries .
Japan &apos;s path to &quot; become a permanent member &quot; began in the early 1990s , and the Tokyo International Conference on African Development hosted by Japan began in 1993 as well ; this was by no means a coincidence !
African countries occupy 53 seats in the United Nations , making the continent an important source of votes in the UN . If Japan wants to enter the Permanent Security Council , it cannot afford to forget Africa .
Opinions regarding the extremist &quot; Islamic State &quot; organization and terrorist activities were also exchanged with relevant representatives from various countries .
The &quot; western division &quot; shall visit 7 countries such as Sierra Leone , Liberia , and Guinea-Bissau .
The Japanese foreign minister Fumio Kishida also disclosed his aims during this session of conference on African development at the United Nations Security Council meeting .
During this period , Abe announced that in order to ensure stability to sub-Saharan African countries , Japan will provide an aid of 100 billion Japanese Yen ( approximately equivalent to 6.1 billion RMB ) across a period of 5 years .
Observers generally believe that there are two main objectives for Japan &apos;s generosity to Africa all this time : The first is to increase Japan &apos;s existence in Africa , and the second is to win the support of African nations for its bid to become a permanent member of the UN Security Council .
Yang Bojiang , an expert on Japan-related issues , analyzed and concluded , &quot; From a political perspective , Africa may lag in terms of development on a relative basis , but it has a large number of countries . Japan has always regarded it as a &quot; major source of votes . &quot; &quot;
In the future , Japan will not be abandoning this . They will continue to strengthen their work in Africa and will not give it up .
In terms of economy , Japan has stronger production capacity , but its domestic market is somewhat limited , especially given the low birth rate and aging population that have resulted in a comparatively low internal demand .
However , from Junichiro Koizumi 10 years ago to Abe 10 years later , Japan has initiated several &quot; dashing attempts &quot; to enter the UN Permanent Security Council , all of which has ended in failure .
Japan specialist Yang Bojiang believed that Japan &apos;s intent to become a permanent member was crystal clear , but the path to becoming a permanent member would be difficult .
To achieve its own objectives , Japan must first build good relations with neighboring countries . In particular , whether in terms of geopolitical contention , national disputes or historical understanding , Japan must have the correct attitude .
The Haikou Maritime Court put the case on record early morning to ensure the rights of the parties concerned with the sinking of the Lingao fishing boat
Relatives of the three sailors who perished arrived at the Haikou Maritime Court at 4am on August 7 to file an application for property preservation before prosecution to detain the vessel suspected of causing the accident .
After the incident on the 4th day , the cargo freighter suspected for the cause of the accident was detained by the Maritime Safety Administration at Haikou Xiuying Port to support the investigation .

Traditional customs with new highlights - 2016 Ullam Cultural Festival unveiled at Victoria Park in Hong Kong
Music with drums and gongs , traditional snacks , fanciful decorations , and a chock-a-block crowd at the scene .
The &quot; 2016 Ullam Cultural Festival &quot; organized by the Federation of Hong Kong Chiu Chow Community Organizations will be held at Victoria Park from 12th to the 14th . This will be the largest Ullam celebration held in Hong Kong .
Other than the &quot; Catching the Single &quot; from the previous events , a new game of &quot; Family Piling &quot; was added for the whole family to enjoy .
A comic is used to introduce the cultural history of Ullam festival . The venue also included 3D photograph area based on the Ullam theme , traditional snacks , and mobile traditional hands-on workshops that attracted many children and overseas visitors to visit the place and experience its attractions .
A French couple stayed in the event venue for nearly 3 hours , and had a great experience with the mini floral card workshop .
&quot; I found this special festival on the net , and decided to come and have a look . Its really interesting . &quot;
They expressed that though France have similar holidays to celebrate historical characters , the atmosphere is more somber unlike this place where there is music , food , and an opportunity to learn about the traditional arts .
She said : &quot; It is surprising to see an ancestral worshiping ceremony of such scale and organization in a busy financial metropolis such as Hong Kong . &quot;
&quot; This not only highlighted the diversity of Chinese culture , but also allowed more people to learn about these traditional handicraft and pass on this legacy . &quot;
Wu Yim-chung , overall coordinator of this event , said , &quot; We didn &apos;t want to have scary decorations for the Hungry Ghost Cultural Festival so that people , particularly little kids , dare not approach . &quot;
&quot; We hope that by providing a younger setting and decor for the event , youths will be able to learn that the Ullam Festival aims to communicate the virtue of filial piety and thanksgiving . &quot;
He also said that a total of 24 teams will take part in this &quot; compete with lonely souls for sacrificial offerings &quot; contest . In addition to social groups and organizations , they are also working with a few schools to allow students to take part in the contest .
It is reported that the Hungry Ghost Festival of the Federation of Hong Kong Chiu Chow Community has been included in the &quot; National Grade Intangible Cultural Heritage Catalog &quot; in 2011 .
On the night of the 11th , China National Peking Opera Company brought the Legend of the White Snake to Mexico City , presenting a true blue Peking Opera feast to local audiences at the Mexico Palace of Fine Arts .
As a key performance item for the China-Latin America Cultural Exchange Year , the China National Peking Opera Company shall provide a total of 7 Peking Opera performances at 5 cities , including Mexico City , the capital of Mexico , Córdoba , and Juárez .
The audience smiled and applauded with the evolving plot and the theatrical performance given by the artistes of the Legend of the White Snake .
Marisa Giménez Cacho , who had watched a Peking Opera performance 15 years ago , accompanied her daughter throughout the entire show .
&quot; This was a fantastic performance . The music , lighting and stage performance left an indelible impression on me ...... I feel that it is absolutely necessary for my daughter to also come and understand Chinese culture and the art of Chinese Peking opera . &quot;
The passion of the Mexican audience left an indelible impression on Fu Jia , the young actress who played the role of Madame White Snake .
&quot; I didn &apos;t realize that the Mexican audience was so passionate . Originally , I was somewhat concerned about whether they would understand the story , but I could see today that they were able to grasp the plot and numerous jokes . I didn &apos;t expect that . &quot;
Qiu Xiaoqi , the Chinese Ambassador to Mexico , said that the various cultural exchange events for the China-Latin America Cultural Exchange Year will play an active role in improving mutual understanding and friendship between the people of China and Mexico .
Next year is the 45th anniversary for the establishment of official diplomatic ties between China and Mexico . Additional cultural exchanges and events will be held in two countries .
Liu Cigui went to Sanya to investigate and study &quot; dual remediation and dual urban construction &quot; requirements to improve city construction management standards
In the morning of the 12th , Liu Cigui chaired a conference and listened to reports on the implementation &quot; dual remediation &quot; and &quot; dual construction &quot; pilot programs as well as opinions and recommendations provided by various departments .
Liu Cigui fully acknowledged the results and positive experiences and effective methods achieved for the step-by-step demonstration project .
Liu Cigui highlighted that Sanya must firmly leverage historical development opportunities , and use the pilot programs of &quot; ecological restoration and urban repair &quot; and &quot; sponge city and integrated pipeline corridor development city &quot; as key bases so as to give full play to its demonstration leadership role in the Province &apos;s economic and social development .
To improve the globalization standards for the International Travelling Island to better serve as a benchmark company , efforts shall include focusing on the details , enriching global elements , and building fine global brands .
In order to successfully play a leadership role in urban-rural integration and regional tourism , the building of towns with unique styles should be accelerated , tourism elements should be integrated in every project , and tourist attractions should be built in every village and town .
To ensure that the &quot; 100-day Mega Campaign for Servicing Social Investments &quot; properly serves its pilot effect , a number of major projects and parks and proper implementation of high quality undertakings must be implemented . Every project requirement must be fulfilled accordingly .
Zhang Qi , provincial party committee member and party committee secretary of Sanya City , Wang Lu , the vice provincial governor , and Lu Zhiyuan , secretary general of the provincial government , participated in this investigative conference .
During her 14 years of sports career , Ms. Deng Yaping won 18 world champions and became the first winner of four Olympic gold medals in Chinese history .
She has topped the world leaderboard in table tennis for 8 consecutive years , making her the longest reigning &quot; world queen &quot; in the history of table tennis .
On September 26 , 2010 , he served as the deputy secretary general of People &apos;s Daily and the general manager of the People Search Internet Corporation , making him a member of the upper management .
A few days ago , she and Yu Minhong together jointly created the first sports industry innovation and entrepreneurial platform in China .
The athletic associations in China also have their own team of superstar coaches . These coaches have won numerous glories for their country as athletes . After retiring from their athletic career , they began teaching their experiences and what they &apos;ve learned to younger athletes who would then go on to become champions in their own right .
As the first Chinese world champion in men &apos;s gymnastics , Huang Yubin became a coach after retirement .
Working up from the women &apos;s team coach to the men &apos;s team coach , then to the main coach , Huang Yubin has created an &quot; Olympic gold medalist winners , &quot; leading the team to acquire the legendary achievement of 9 golds , 1 silver , and 4 bronzes in the Beijing Olympics .
Subsequently , Tian Liang continued to be an advertisement spokesperson . In recent years , he has also played the roles of a &quot; cowboy , &quot; &quot; Lei Feng &quot; and other major characters .
Many NBA players have proven themselves , but progress for some meant regress for others .
Due to aging or restrictions on playing time , performance of several players may become worse for each season .
Of course , some of this &quot; degeneration &quot; could be attributed to lowered statistics , but the true ability of these players probably stayed the same .
Although Wade is still regarded as one of the best shooting guards in the NBA , his performance with the Bulls will unlikely be as good as when he was at Miami Heat .
He and Rondo has limited perimeter shot range , and their superstar Butler only has a 32.8 % chance of scoring with a three-point shot . Offenses they head for the next season will be extremely crowded .
After arriving at the Windy City , Wade &quot; the Lightning &quot; will , where possible , pass the ball to Butler and Rondo while he himself adopts a more wholesome gameplay strategy in conventional games .
Okafor &apos;s position is quite precarious . As the only option for the 76ers in the last season , he was forced to jostle with Simons and Embiid for play time and ownership of the ball during the new season .
This competition may not be imminent . Simmons still has to adapt to the NBA game . Embiid also has to fully recover from his injuries as soon as possible . Whether Okafor will hold a permanent position in the 76ers however , remains questionable .
In the previous season , Okafor &apos;s 32 % scoring rate was attributed to low post offense . This ratio was higher than that of Cousins , Vučević , and Brook Lopez . His usage rate is also amongst the top-40 of the entire NBA .
As Simmons has demonstrated great potential as a point forward and Embiid is starting to get a physique more suitable for NBA games , Okafor &apos;s position will only become less stable .
For the last two seasons , Thompson has been one of the top-20 most commonly fielded players in the NBA . Those were his most impressive two seasons in his entire career .
The problem is that with the arrival of Durant , the chance for having Thompson play in the games will definitely drop , further lowering his chances of performing .
This not only affected the chances for Thompson to play the game , his field goal attempts will be vastly reduced in the next season , and reduce the challenges faced by his opponents when defending against him .
The arrival of Durant will definitely result in a drop in numbers among Warriors &quot; players , but Thompson will probably have the most to lose .
This does not mean that Thompson &apos;s standards have dropped . In fact , it appears that he &apos;s making sacrifices for the sake of the entire team .
Parker &apos;s performance last season was better than his stats suggested . Not only did Parker achieve his career best in rebound efficiency , his chemistry with Aldridge also benefited the Spurs .
Duncan has retired , while Ginóbili announced that he will play for another year . The GDP combination has finally come to an end . As the youngest of the three , there is little gas in the tank of the French sports car .
Only Jabbar , Jordan , and Russell won more standard MVP games than James after obtaining their third championship rings . Jordan is the only person with more FMVP than James .
O yes , James has just helped deliver the first professional sports championship trophy to Cleveland in 52 years .
James , who is in the 14th season of his professional career , needs to better retain his physical strength to prepare well for the playoffs .
Therefore , during the regular season , James &quot; stats may well decline further . He will share more of his burden with Owen but he will easily remain one of the top 3 NBA players .
&quot; We must promote the skills learned at home across Russia &quot;
On the 12th day , local time , Huang Jing , the chairperson of the Moscow Chinese Community Chinese Alliance Committee excitedly said these lines when meeting the China News Service reporter .
She recently attended a &quot; Traditional Art ( Calligraphy and Painting ) Training for Overseas Chinese Art Communities &quot; hosted by Overseas Chinese Affairs Office of the State Council .
When I first joined the workshop , I didn &apos;t know where to begin as far as calligraphy and painting was concerned . After the course ended , I was already able to paint and write my own works .
Upon returning to Moscow , I shall use my acquired knowledge and skills in my contributions toward the spread and advocation of Chinese culture .
Na Yanwei , the secretary general of the Russian Chinese Culture Promotion Society , participated in this training class and felt the same .
She said she achieved significant improvements with the coach &apos;s help in the training class , and experienced the responsibilities of becoming an &quot; overseas seed for spreading Chinese culture . &quot;
Na Yanwei said that after he returns to Russia , he will continue to spread and advocate traditional Chinese culture amongst the Chinese community and Russian people who love Chinese culture .
On 19 : 35 today , Chongqing Dangdai Lifan will play away against Beijing Sinobo Guoan in one of the first matches of the 22nd round of the Chinese Super League .
At the 29th minute , Wang Dong scored a goal with a penalty kick . At the 39th minute , the newly fielded Kardec , assisted by Fernando , scored his first goal in the Chinese Super League . At minute 81 , the Guoan team managed to score a goal .
After the game was on for 10 minutes , Lifan continued to press their offense and won multiple corner kick opportunities . Fernando attempted a small-angle volley strike that was kept out of the endline by Guoan defenses .
In the 15th minute , Zhang Xize crossed in midfield with Yilmaz having already rushed into the penalty box , but lone defender Liu Yu kicked the ball away .
After 1 minute , Piao Cheng managed to work his way in from the left . Yu Dabao made a sweeping shot at the goal within the penalty area but missed the shot . Deng Xiaofei , the goalkeeper of Lifan , managed to keep the ball safe in his custody .
Fernando struck from the right , back passing when faced with two defenders before suddenly launching a pick pass to the goal area . Kardec rushed forward through the defense but was floored by Lei Tenglong &apos;s flying tackle . The referee rewarded Kardec with a penalty kick and gave Lei Tenglong with a yellow card .
Guoan swapped out a player in the 37th minute . Zhang Xiaobin was replaced by Chang Chiming to defy his ex-team .
Kardec broke away and crossed in front of the penalty area . Fernando sent a low shot from the left , and Kardec conveniently shot the ball in for a goal .
This is the goal by Kardec in his first CSL game . Lifan leads by 2 : 0 .
Not long after the start of the second half , Fernando forced his way through the defense and won a free kick on the right . However , the shot was at a tight angle and blasted over the goal .
After Deng Xiaofei was given a yellow card for wasting time , substitute Peng Xinli was also given a yellow card for a foul in the penalty area .
At the 56th minute , Zhang Chiming cut in from the left , and passed the ball to Zhang Xizhe who curled the ball toward goal but was blocked by Deng Xiaofei .
In the penalty area , Liu Yu savagely raked Krimets . He and the emotional Wang Dong received the yellow card one after another .
At the 63rd minute , Fernando attempted an offensive from the right , but was directly rammed by Krimets , causing him to fall over . Fernando was extremely displeased with Krimets &apos;s action , and the latter was given a yellow card .
After a minute , Fernando then went through the right , demonstrating his rapid offensive skills . Yu Dabao took after him in desperate defense , fouling in the process and receiving a yellow card .
Yılmaz managed to breakthrough the penalty area but fell after being intercepted by Zheng Yourong . The referee decided to provide Yılmaz with a penalty kick which he then scored , resulting in a 2 : 1 for Lifan versus Guoan .
On the 86th minute , Zhou Ting crossed the ball in on the right . Sergeev chested the ball down in the middle of the box and took shot at goal . Deng Xiaofei again dived splendidly to push the ball away .
After the four-minute overtime , Lifan kept the score at 2-1 until the final whistle , and beat Guoan in the away game .
After taking 3 valuable points , Lifan &apos;s total score has reached 27 points , currently giving the team a rank 10 position on the leaderboards .
Lehmann will serve as a pundit for the Bundesliga &apos;s media partners , and take part in various local fan activities .
According to information , ambassadors Raisman and Matthäus of the German Bundesliga will be initiating their Legends Tour this autumn in Asia and the Americas to prepare fans for the opening ceremony of the 2016 / 2017 season .
This event will span two continents and cover 4 first-tier cities . They will fan the flames of public attention for the new season at these locations with fellow fans .
The German premier league Bundesliga is lauded as one of the top five leagues of Europe ( English Premier League , the Primera División of Spain , Serie A of Italy , Bundesliga of Germany , and France Ligue 1 of France ) , and is therefore one of the most important sporting event for the football kingdom of Germany .
As one of the most influential leagues in the world , the 2014-2015 season of Bundesliga attracted about 13.30 million visitors to watch the football games .
German premier league teams include Bayern Munich and Dorftmund , as well as famous football stars such as Thomas Müller , Philipp Lahm , and Mario Götze who are extremely well-known in China .
Bundesliga places great hopes to provide Chinese football fans with more accessible and prompt channels for acquiring the latest information of the league , and will be using Weibo , Youku , and WeChat Chinese language platforms that the league has previously established .
Unfortunately , the latest monthly report of OPEC indicated continuous increase in crude oil production volume in July . Saudi Arabia even reached in a record height in terms of production volume .
This report couldn &apos;t help but trigger market suspicion over OPEC &apos;s credibility . The path toward recovery in oil prices is still difficult .
On Monday , Qatar &apos;s Energy Minister Mohammed Bin Saleh Al-Sada who holds OPEC &apos;s rotating presidency said that OPEC will hold an unofficial meeting during the International Energy Foundation conference which will be held between September 26 and 28 .
OPEC &apos;s monthly report published on Wednesday showed that OPEC &apos;s total output ( including Gabon ) in July rose by 46,000 barrels / day to 33.11 million barrels / day .
OPEC expressed in its monthly report that the low price of crude oil has encouraged more refineries around the world to produce more refined oil products , worsening the issue of excessive supply in the market .
This news , coupled with the US raising its crude oil production forecast and unexpected increase in crude oil stockpiles has caused global oil prices to fall for two consecutive days .
The price of light crude oil futures for delivery in September closed 2.48 % lower on the New York Mercantile Exchange as of Wednesday , while the price of Brent crude oil futures for delivery in October fell 2.07 % .
Reuters believe that the proposed conference of the petroleum producing countries is unlikely to order significant reduction in production . Data published by the US Energy Information Administration also cooled the market .
Fars , the official media company of Iran , quoted Iranian Minister of Petroleum Zanganeh who said that the maximum crude oil production of Iran will be 3.85 million barrels per day , the highest volume since 2008 .
Once information for the meeting has been released , Novak , the Russian Minister of Energy , expressed that under current oil prices , there is no need to initiate a new round of negotiations regarding frozen assets .
The last time oil producing naitons convened a meeting was in April . OPEC members failed to reach an agreement on any measure .
BMI Research Oil and Gas Analyst Emma Richards said that the market and the media may have over-reacted to the meeting OPEC is about to convene .
Helima Croft , Top Commodities Strategist of Royal Bank of Canada , expressed that OPEC has released signals that they would be reaching an agreement to transform the mood of the market .
This method was like smoke and mirrors to divert people &apos;s attention ( deliberately giving people the wrong impression ) .
Eugen Weinberg , Head of Commodity Research at Commerzbank AG , said that people believe that there is a low possibility for OPEC to use the September meeting to stabilize the market .
This might further disrupt market confidence for OPEC as this organization has &quot; cried wolf &quot; before .
Various areas shall focus random inspection efforts on healthcare institutions that have posted illegal medical advertisements , received a large number of complaints , or subject to multiple penalties in the past .
The National Health and Family Planning Commission and State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine shall supervise , when required , the implementation of project monitoring and inspection for a number of provinces .
Media revealed that the deluge of capital that swamped online health care resulted in the severe product homogeneity problem we see today . The investment boom is waning gradually . Capital has entered a wait-and-see period .
Figures from Hong Kong Ailibi Hospital Management Research Center revealed that many online health care companies close down within the first year of incorporation ; approximately 20 % of newly founded online health care enterprises no longer exist .
However , while most Internet health care companies were struggling to choose between Series A or Series B financing , a number of leading companies in specialized sectors were still able to attract capital .
It seems that &quot; rushing headlong &quot; into the Industry healthcare sector is not the wisest option . One must accurately assess market requirements , be patient , and improve the professionalism and depth of services provided .
Yuyue contributed 12.0000 million dollars , comprising 40 % of the registered capital , while Jointown Pharmaceutical provided 18.0000 million dollars for 60 % of the registered capital .
In recent years , thanks to national policy support in terms of medical informatization , electronic and integrated supply chain management systems have been gradually introduced into different classes of hospitals .
The partnership between Yuyue and Jointown Pharmaceutical aims at meeting market demands and helping hospital establish an advanced supply chain management system . The partnership is also an opportunity to seek additional partnerships .
Unlike many Internet health care companies obsessed with scale and extensive coverage , iBaby focused on the vertical industry of obstetrics from the very beginning , channeling their efforts toward supporting both pregnant mothers and their physicians .
Pregnant mothers can receive 24-hours one-on-one consultation with a specialist physician for free . They can also pay for personal consultation with a specified physician .
At the doctors &quot; end , iBaby has broken down regional restrictions by way of organizing experts to carry out webinars , peer exchanges , case discussions and other mini-seminars .
Currently , three segments have been set up at the doctor &apos;s end , namely , continuing education for doctors , social networking for doctors , and help for doctors .
The contents provided include online learning , medical case studies , and academic exchange ; social networking platform between physicians of the same hospital or same departments ; and doctor-patient relationships or legal assistance necessary for personal lifestyles , entrepreneurship support , and other services .
Media report that CEO Wang Lei expressed that Alibaba Health is &quot; willing to settle down &quot; and takeover the Big Data analytics for health .
Online businesses and data companies lack professionalism , and were unable to achieve uniformity in the terminologies of identical keywords .
Alibaba has structured its presence in the health care industry into three segments , namely Alibaba Health , Tmall Pharmacy , and Alipay &apos;s Future Hospital .
Wang Lei disclosed that starting a medical healthcare company is more challenging when compared to other sectors . &quot; This is not just about making money . You must be patient and get used to loneliness to do this properly . &quot;
Staying up all night to watch the Olympics makes one prone to heart damage
The Olympic games in Brazil are currently all the rage . Even though many of the games are broadcast during midnight hours in China , many fellow citizens will stay up all night to watch these games .
For this , doctors specifically mind people that staying up all night to watch TV sports events may be potentially hazardous to health and could lead to cardiovascular diseases .
For people staying up late into the night , the hormone will be secreted in large volumes , keeping one energized and in a state of alertness . However , such people won &apos;t be able to rest properly and are prone to vasoconstriction , increased blood pressure , and tendency to suffer from cardiovascular diseases .
Han Zhiyuan issued a special reminder to groups with high blood pressure , high blood sugar , high cholesterol , a smoking habit , a family medical history and other cardiovascular risk factors that if they stay up late , they would easily trigger cardiovascular illness .
Staying up late over a long period of time will not only affect one &apos;s cardiovascular function but also one &apos;s gastrointestinal function , immune system and neuroendocrine system ; even the risk of getting cancer will increase .
For fellow senior citizens , Han Zhiyuan recommend avoiding staying up all night to watch the Olympics , especially those who have a history of cardiovascular diseases .
During the previous &quot; FIFA World Cup , &quot; Han Zhiyuan saw a patient in his sixties who suffered a heart attack for staying up late to watch the matches .
Han Zhiyuan said that since the beginning of this year , the department has admitted a number of patients aged 25 years or so with myocardial infraction or stroke . This , to a very large extent , was the result of a lifestyle of staying up late over long periods .

2 . When staying up late at night , drink enough water and eat lots of fruits to prevent the clogging of blood vessels and to enhance systemic immunity .

During the Cold War , the Soviet Union deployed missiles to Cuba , and almost triggered a nuclear war with the US .
This event was regarded as the zenith of the Cold War , and was known in history as the &quot; Cuban missile crisis . &quot;
What was little known was that during the Cold War , a strong solar storm almost sparked a nuclear war between the US and the Soviet Union . This was only publicly disclosed by researchers for the first time on August 9 .
On May 23 , 1967 , a powerful solar storm caused severe disruptions to a North Pole radar station and radio communications of the US military .
This radar is part of the US ballistic missile early warning system , and is used to monitor Soviet missiles .
This thesis , completed by researchers at the University of Colorado , interviewed US military personnel who took part in forecasting and analyzing the sun &apos;s activities at the time , as well as consulted unclassified documents .
The article said the U.S. Air Force kept fighters loaded with nuclear warhead patrolling in the air in 1960s to prevent any sudden nuclear war waged by the U.S.S.R
The US military commander was unaware that the interference was caused by a solar storm and not the Soviet Union , and thus gave orders for all military aircraft to enter combat status .
Fortunately , the potential military conflict was avoided by the study of solar activity and its electromagnetic interference to earth conducted by U.S.army from the end of 1950s .
He then compiled the information provided by the US Air Force Air Weather Service and submitted a detailed report .
The direct consequence of the solar storm is that the US military began viewing space weather as a key component of battle , and established a more powerful space weather early warning system .

Making up for shortcomings of public sporting facilities
The dark and sooty warehouse of the coal mine has become a &quot; verdant &quot; soccer field , and the red brick factory with the pointed top , a modern gymnasium .
The mysterious veil over the Nanluomaying Sports Cultural Park outside Wangjiang Gate of Hangzhou was lifted on National Fitness Day .
This used to be a coal mine , and was left idle after it closed down more than 10 years ago . What remained were numerous illegal buildings and domestic waste .
Renovations created the athletic cultural park that will be formally opened to public visitors in November , providing fellow citizens with a place to exercise . This has undoubtedly heralded a new place for total public participation in athleticism .
One could not help but recall Hangzhou Chen Jinglun Sport School . This &quot; Huangpu Military Academy &quot; of the Chinese swimming world has produced many world champions .
New famous athletes are constantly generated in the swimming pool , providing a lively demonstration of the relationship between the competitive sport and public athleticism . A large base of participating public provide an excellent condition for selecting professional athletes .
The level of competitive sports is closely linked to public athleticism . Competitive sports , to some degree , is determined by public athleticism , and public athleticism is itself determined by the quality of sporting venues .
According to reports , although the average sports venue area per capita in our country as of the end of 2015 was 150 times of that at the founding of the New China , the current figure is still way behind leading athletic nations .
In June this year , the State Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China released the National Fitness Program ( 2016-2020 ) to establish the development of public athleticism as a priority .
To compensate for this defect , relevant departments must fully consider the layout of the sports hall during urban planning .
On the one hand , the public sports stadium has been built , including sports stadiums in entities such as schools . The scope should be expanded to the fullest extent possible , and utilization rates raised as much as possible .
The Rio Olympics is currently all the rage , and has inspired public passion for sports as well as awakened the people &apos;s desire to participate in athletic activities .
After a baby is born , parents must assume responsibility for this life . This responsibility does not merely concern the physical health of the child but also mental development , i.e. education .
Failing in children &apos;s education is a loss in life and family that cannot be compensated by success in career-building .
When a life is born , the new parents must spend time and effort to take care and educate the child , and be responsible to it .
To become responsible , in addition to caring for the body , providing them with a healthy and spiritual education , the children are taught how to socialize properly , become responsible adults , and gain success .
Good family education means that parents must spend time with their children often and provide them with love , patient care , and teach them how to develop well-mannered speech and behavior , allowing children to achieve better learning and improvements to their mental skills .
Every saying and act of parents will influence the development of their child . The child will often mimic their parents , just like the traditional saying that goes : &quot; A dragon gives birth to a dragon , a phoenix gives rise to a phoenix . A rat &apos;s child will eventually learn to dig holes . &quot; The child will take after its parents .
Parents must provide a good role model in front of their children , control their words and saying , and develop an excellent character of their own . All this can indirectly help build a positive personality in children and make them more successful .

This secret has accompanied Emmy for a while . Usually , the problems are not that serious .
Although she had to use study and work using scattered , modular time slots , she was able to complete her tasks and achieve great results .
However , when confronted with a heavy task and pressed for time , Amy would be in agony and feel tortured .
The purpose of an individual &apos;s resistance toward self-disclosure and its emotional experience lies in preventing the individual &apos;s self-awareness and self-esteem from being threatened .
Some behavioral psychologists interpret resistance as an individual &apos;s defiance of efforts to correct his or her behavior .
I tried to have Emmy perform a training , using a breathing routine to relax and calm herself down in order to experience the pain .
Upon leaving the sense of being trapped , she could feel that she was more relaxed and regained her freedom .

The head of the Department of Industry Coordination of the National Development and Reform Commission pointed out today that overcapacity in the steel industry was a global issue .
Production capacity utilization in our country is higher than that of the global average , and higher than those in the US and Europe .
Our country has taken definite and effective measures to address excess production capacity , and preliminary results are gradually emerging .
The person-in-charge pointed out that the State Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China has placed great importance upon the global issue of excessive steel and iron production capacity .
All departments and regions shall actively implement the plans of State Council , and work conscientiously to reduce crude steel production capacity by about 45 million tonnes this year .
From the perspective of domestic national conditions , China does not encourage steel exports . On the contrary , it has adopted a series of practical measures to control steel exports .
The person in charge emphasized that the international trade of steel products is essentially market behavior . It is triggered by demand from importing nations , as well as the voluntary choice of consumers after taking into consideration a number of factors such as the products &quot; price-performance ratio .
The implementation of protectionist measures will not help to fundamentally resolve the development issues of the global steel industry . Instead , this would only result in a further attack on international trade order .
When talking about the debt , the person-in-charge emphasized that the key for resolving the debt issue is to properly take care of excessive production capacity .
As steel enterprises have massive assets , and cover a broad spectrum , the debt relationships of some of these enterprises are complicated . If handled inappropriately , regional risk could result .
The person in charge described that recent increase in economic pressures have led to weakening of overall demands from the society . Production capacity utilization for a number of industries have decreased , increasing the difficulties for corporate production and operations .
Some enterprises were unable to adapt to changes in the market environment . Business operations became unsustainable , and were even on the brink of collapse . Constrained by institutional mechanisms however , there were more hindrances to market-oriented exits , resulting in &quot; zombie enterprises . &quot;
The existence of such enterprises distorted market signals , lowered the utilization rate of factor resources , increased the cost of public administration , and hindered the building of a fair and competitive market environment .
The major reason for the losses is similar to the difficulty confronting the global steel industry - market demand is sluggish and capacity utilization rates are low .
Our nation mainly adopts a market mechanism , economic means and the rule of law . The government is primarily focused on carrying out various aspects of worker resettlement and social stability , ensuring fair and just market order .
The person in charge emphasized that the next step forward would be to steadfastly continue to eliminate excess production capacity , and to ensure that the goal of removing 100 million to 150 million tonnes of crude steel capacity in five years would be achieved .

Before initiating the shadow learning session , the Chinese tourist police also had a dialog with their Russian compatriots at the Moscow tourist police base .
&quot; I often talk with Chinese tourists , and I feel very happy to see them visiting Russia . &quot;
&quot; The most frequently asked questions are : How do you get there ? Where is such and such a monument ? How do you hail a cab ? How do I return to the hotel ? &quot;
Lysakov , the Capitan of Tourist Policy said , Moscow has been attracting more foreign tourists in recent years thanks to the improving urban environment and tourism condition .
To meet the needs of tourism development , a tourist police team has been established in July 2014 . The team shall patrol major destinations to provide assistance to tourists and provide crowd control .
Currently , all Moscow tourism police officers are fluent English speakers ; some have even mastered Spanish and German .
Police headquarters divided them into nine teams according to their language skills . They attended two classes per week , and learned self-defense , the law , and foreign languages .
&quot; Currently , two tourism police officers have begun to learn Chinese , and are quite good at it . We still have to continue to raise their Chinese language standards , &quot; said Lysakov .
lysakov told the reporter that since its establishment , the Moscow tourism police form has gained a certain degree of experience that may be useful for fellow police officers at Sanya .
He believes that collaboration of Russian and Chinese police departments will help improve the sense of safety of citizens visiting the other country as tourists .
&quot; The staff recruitment , policing model and equipment of the Moscow tourism police , as well as the positive interaction with tourists have inspired us significantly , &quot; said Chen Xiaokun .
