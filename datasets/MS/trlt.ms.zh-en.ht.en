Junior Doctor Strike: Calling for new laborer actions
Junior Doctors’ representatives called on the alliance to approve their adoption of new labor action aimed at the new contract dispute.
The Junior Doctors Committee of the British Medical Association will request that all its members begin to support more labor actions from the start of September.
The Junior Doctors association expressed that the ministers have yet to resolve concerns regarding the contract.
Junior doctors and medical school students have voted, in July, against reaching a contractual agreement with the British Medical Association.
Of the members who voted, 58% opposed the contract transaction.
Ellen McCourt, main representative for junior doctors of the medical association, expressed in Thursday evening through a letter to fellow members published on Twitter that the government “has remained silent” regarding issues that led to the opposition of the contract.
She said, “On this basis, the executive committee of the Junior Doctors Committee has voted for complete rejection of the proposed new contract, and call for new formal negotiations related to all the concerns.”
In response to the government’s silence, the Junior Doctor executive committee has formally asked the British Medical Association today to hold a special meeting permitting a long-term plan for increasing labor actions starting in early September.
This dispute led to the Junior Doctor participating in a total of 6 strikes this year, including the first general strike in the history of the National Health Service of the UK.
Dr Johann Malawana, leader of the British Medical Association’s (BMA) junior doctors committee resigned after the terms and conditions of the contract BMA recommended was voted down.
During the pre-vote meeting of 54,000 junior doctors and medical students, he had expressed to the members of the British Medical Association that the deal was good and should be accepted.
After the vote, Secretary of State for Health Jeremy Hunt said that the contract will be imposed on medical staff in the UK.
Russia and Turkey - “An alliance of misfits?”
A hand gesture ended this crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday. The two parties shook hands, and announced that the eight-month long war of words and economic sanctions will officially cease.
However, when Vladimir Putin received the President of Turkey at the gilded palace halls of St. Petersburg, I had a strong feeling that this was the reconciliation Ankara had most hoped to see.
Yes, both parties shook hands.
However, Putin only gave a gentle smile. This seems to indicate little passion, even according to Putin’s subsumed standards.
According to the report, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan mentioned his “good friend” Putin five times.
I don't remember it well.
He also promised that relations with Russia will return to the level prior to the crisis, or even better.
On the following day, a newspaper wrote that Erdoğan behaved as though nothing has happened.
I believe however, that his enthusiasm implied something quite the opposite.
However, Putin remained cold and said that he did not forget anything.
In fact, the first thing he mentioned in his opening remarks was the reason for the current crisis: Turkey shot down a Russian attack aircraft at the Syrian border.
Moscow reacted intensely at the time.
Mr Putin took aim at this issue, and accused Ankara of stabbing Moscow in the back.
An attack by someone who is supposedly a friend is hard to stomach.
It is difficult, perhaps even impossible, for both parties to establish true trust.
Russian public opinion has started to change since November.
For months, the government controlled media launched a shocking all-out attack on Ankara.
Suddenly, the Turks seemed to want to assume responsibility for everything.
In particular, the most severe criticisms came from senior White House officials: Mr Erdoğan’s family members received gains from illegal oil trading with regions in Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He has already denied that statement.
However, news from St Petersburg revealed that it was time to move on.
The pretext of this meeting is that Putin has received an apology from the President of Turkey Erdoğan.
Russia can declare victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of a truce were crystal clear.
First, Erdoğan was nearly deposed after the coup failed last month. Therefore, he needed support from all his friends.
Ongoing terrorist attacks have clearly shocked him.
Economic incentives exist as well.
Russia’s sanctions against Turkey generated significant impacts, and include banning of charter flights that sends millions of Russian tourists to the shores of Turkey.
This figure has drastically decreased by nearly 90%.
With resumption of flights, Russia’s travel agencies and charter companies breathed a sign of relief.
They will be welcoming the Mediterranean tourism wave at the end of the season.
The national television channel even predicted that once imports of Turkish farm products are once again allowed through the borders, the prices of fruits and vegetables will drop.
A report in Russian newspaper Vedemosti stated, “Tourists that way, tomatoes back here.”
To Moscow, this visit also provides added political value.
Ankara was furious with the West’s weak response to the intentions concerning the takeover.
In addition, Ankara had, for some time, been unhappy with the slow progress of the EU accession negotiations and Putin’s meddling. Putin was keen on using political chill and weakening the relationship between Turkey and the Western world.
For supporting the current government after the failure of the coup, the Russian leader will definitely get himself on the positive side of Ankara.
Note that this was gift to Moscow which has always had a deep-rooted fear for regime change.
Hence, during the meeting held at this luxurious seaside palace, Russia and Turkey, two countries that had been rejected and abused by the western world, became allies. An analyst described this as an “alliance of misfits”.
Serious disagreement still existed between both parties in spite of a public settlement.
Syria is a key factor. Moscow has recently played the role of a mediator in Syria. However, Russia and Turkey supported opposing factions.
It is predictable that after a 3-hour preliminary talk, both presidents would express at the press conference that they have yet to broach the topic.
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided questions regarding disagreements between both parties, while Putin emphasized them.
Both parties failed to reach a clear consensus on seeking common ground while reserving differences on the issue of Syria.
Given months of open hostility and the possibility of triggering a large-scale disaster brought about by the shooting down of a Russian fighter jet by NATO member Turkey, reinitiating dialogue between the leaders of the two countries is definitely a good thing.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer serve customers outside Scotland
According to the CEO of Royal Bank of Scotland, the bank will be reduced into a logistic department.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer service customers outside of Scotland.
Rose McEwan shared with the Scotland branch of BBC about how devoted the Royal Bank of Scotland in their global ambition.
On the edge of bankruptcy some eight years ago, however, there was no choice but to accept a bailout. From then on, those pursuits were abandoned.
During this time, the brand building strategist used “RBS” to protect the other consumer finance brands.
The Group has spent millions of pounds to sponsor the Six Nations Championship in rugby and Andy Murray, winner of The Championships, Wimbledon to support international sports events.
Currently, however, the correct measure is to provide national brands with opportunities of exposure.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used by Scottish clients but will not revert to its original form.
In England and Wales, all references apart from those at the headquarters and the stock exchange shall be changed to National Westminster Bank.
The brand of Ulster Bank is used by customers in the Republic of Ireland and the autonomous Northern Ireland.
There is also a number of smaller, private banks such as Coutts, Adam & Co., Drummond, and Holt’s Military Bank.
Mr McEwan was interviewed during a trip to Inverness to visit customers and staff.
He told the BBC Scotland, “The RBS brand will end up becoming our investor brand and the one that our staff are employed with, because we are now becoming much more a bank of brands.”
As the bank itself became an international label, RBS thus became a global brand.
What I want to say is that our current priority is no longer the world; we have instead switched our focus to the domestic market.
Every brand symbolized a specific field. Our staff serve the customers via different brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland has indicated that it would no longer sponsor the Six Nations Championship. At the same time, it is working diligently to raise the image of different brands by sponsoring sporting events.
The CEO expressed: “Now we’ve become a bank of multiple brands because privately, we’ve been investigating the means by which we can become a bank that provides a better service to our customer.”
If we claimed, 3 years ago, that we aim to become a giant bank of multiple brands, people will definitely be laughing at us.
Currently, we are prioritizing our focus on customer requirements, and I believe that you have noticed these changes.
I believe we can re-activate these brands. This seems to be the right time to do so.
Victory of Dettori and Predilection providing the 3,000th career win
2 wins at Newmarket allow Dettori to reach 3,000 career wins and hold a champagne party afterwards
On Friday, professional jockey Frankie Dettori achieved his 3,000th career win at Newmarket.
Mounting Predilection, the horse trained by the famous John Gosden, he raced down the tracks and achieved two victories at that night which helped him achieve 3,000 career wins.
This 45-year old Italian is the sixth professional jockey to achieve this milestone in flat racing.
The first five are: Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery, and Willie Carson.
Dettori, three-time champion and winner of the Ghayyar races, said: “This is very special.”
I’m excited because my family was there at the site
I am happy about what I’ve achieved at Newmarket because this is the place where I started 30 years ago.
This is not a large scale horse racing event nor the Royal Ascot. This is just a normal Friday night with 20,000 members in the audience.
I am very pleased and very humbled.
Crowd cheered as Dettori brought in Predilection after claiming victory
Two equestrians have made this achievement in the cross-country event, namely champion rider Richard Johnson and 20-times world champion who has retired, Sir Anthony McCoy. Sir McCoy has broke the record by achieving more than 4,300 victories in his entire career.
Piggott is a nine-times derby champion and has achieved 4,493 wins throughout his career.
Dettori is one of the best jockey of this time. It is not surprising that he will be able to make it to this milestone achievement. Not many people before him could claim to have reached this step.
He is fashionable and has a well-built figure. However, the reason that he was able to stand out from the through the weighing station was his rational use of tactics.
He is an impressive equestrian and its representative. For many years, his passion and charms have attracted a large number of fans to the sport.
A few weeks ago, I told Dettori at Epsom that if he wasn’t a jockey merely during weekends and at major races, he would already have won 6,000 victories!
In truth, Dettori is the jockey with the best record of riding winners that Britain has seen in 30 years. This is something extremely important.
He has a lively personality, which is good news for the British horse racing society. In addition to that, he is an astounding jockey.
Dettori celebrates milestone with signature flying dismount
Dettori has always been a classic representative for the British sport of flat racing for over 20 years with his distinctive flying finish and flying dismount.
His career is like a roller coaster.
He is a champion of many competitions, and have achieved the famous “7 consecutive victories” in the 1996 Royal Ascot horse races. However, he was also affected by a plane crash and barred from the races due to use of prohibited substances.
Three years ago, he found it taxing when he first returned to the game after a six-month suspension, but he showed amazing strength of character, and finally returned to his peak form, defying doubters.
Dettori once said that he probably doesn’t have much time left, but hope that he can participate in the games before he reaches 50 years of age.
President of Russia, Putin, has relieved Sergei Ivanov of his position as the Chief of Staff of the Presidential Executive Office.
Russian President Vladimir Putin dismissed Sergei Ivanov as Chief of Staff of the Presidential executive Office unexpectedly.
For many years, Ivanov has always been a member of a core group of individuals deeply trusted by Putin.
Ivanov, now 63 years old, has been appointed as a special representative for environment and transportation issues.
A statement from the Kremlin said that Mr Putin had “decreed to relieve Ivanov of his duties as head of the Russian presidential administration", but gave no reason.
Anton Vaino, who has served as Ivanov’s assistant since 2012, has been appointed as his successor.
Mr Ivanov, 44, was a former diplomat.
He was born in Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, in 1972, and graduated from the famous Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and previously worked at the embassy at Tokyo.
According to the official website of the Kremlin (in Russian), he was in charge of managing presidential proposals and government officials.
After receiving his appointment, he said to Mr Putin, “Thank you for your trust.”
I believe the most important job of this government is to support laws drafted by the leader of our country and implement administrative directives.
Putin told Russian television channels on Friday that Ivanov has resigned on his own request, and recommended Ivanov to succeed him as well.
Can this smile convince anyone?
Moscow is still confused about this act.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin's closest allies and, like him, served in the Soviet security service (KGB).
As the Chief of Staff, he was once one of the most influential persons in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin broadcast by State television, the two men said that it was the Chief of Staff himself who tendered the resignation.
The candidate may be smiling in front of the camera, but no one is buying it, especially on the eve of local elections.
So, is this the result of having been defeated amid some sort of power struggle?
There is no way of knowing anything from this.
The official narrative however - a candidate who was previously regarded as a presidential candidate would suddenly choose to preside over Russia’s environmental policy - caused much suspicion.
The Kremlin website cited a conversation between Mr Ivanoc and Mr Putin. He said, “Yes, at the beginning of 2012, I did, in a conversation, ask you to appoint me to this difficult post, or you could even say, troublesome post, for a four-year period.”
“The result is that I've been the Chief of Staff of the Presidential Executive Office for 4 years and 8 months.”
Mr Ivanov assumed this position in December 2011.
Prior to that, he served as the deputy prime minister and defense minister.
He was a member of the Russian Security Council, and like Putin, was a former  member of the National Security Agency.
At the end of the 1990s, when Mr Putin was the director of the Federal Security Service (FSB, formerly the National Security Agency). Mr Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
After Mr Putin came into power, he designated Mr Ivanov as one of five persons in his trusted inner circle.
Other people thought that Ivanov may be able to become the President of Russia after Putin, because it is illegal in Russia to serve three consecutive terms as President.
However, the position finally went to another trusted Putin aid, Dmitry Medvedev.
Prior to taking office as President again three and a half years later, Mr Putin served as Prime Minister of Russia.
Mysterious fish spotted in Banff garden
A resident in Banff suddenly found a fish in the garden, and called for help.
Kevin Bain thought the 75 fish might be the sand eel brought by the waterspout.
Mr. Bain lives in a place about 500 meters away from the ocean. He published the video with the strange phenomenon on Periscope and hopes that someone is able to explain how these 2-inch long fishes appeared.
Queensferry Crossing is now connected to Fife
The planned completion for the 1.35 billion Sterling Pound project is May 2017.
Engineers have joined the north deck and viaduct of Queensferry Crossing, and said that the bridge now provides access to Fife.
The joining of the “deck fans” around the three towers of each bridge is near completion, and the project is the first joint bridge.
The bridge that started at Fife has a length of 600 meters and a mass of 30,000 tons.
10,000 tonnes of steel, 20,000 tonnes of concrete and 46 stay cables were used.
The GBP1.35 billion project is scheduled for completion in May 2017.
Minister of Economy Keith Brown visited the venue today and became one of the first people to ascend the Crossing.
He said: “This is a historical moment for the building of the Queensferry Crossing.”
We have witnessed the engineering work of such a massive project. More than 30,000 tonnes of concrete and steel were used just to build this section of this enormous bridge.
Despite the sheer size and mass of this bridge, completion of the elevated bridge and the joining of the bridge surface require precision engineering as well as equipment and parts made with great accuracy.
On the whole, close to 79% of the bridge deck has been installed. The concrete deck of the last bridge deck was cast at Rosyth today. In other words, the entire bridge deck is ready.
Queensferry Crossing Construction Company project supervisor Michael Martin said: “The first closure of the bridge surface is an important milestone for any bridge project.”
As far as this awesome project, the joining of the bridge displays cutting edge civil engineering technology.
Install the road slabs at the last section, and after connecting them to the road slabs of the expanded Beiqiaobao, join the remaining gaps on the north or the section close to land.
Completing this work requires shifting the northern approach viaduct by 700 millimeters.
This was a task of enormous scale, and one of extreme precision.
It is described as enormous because the viaduct is 222 meters long and weighs approximately 6,000 tonnes, requiring an incline of about 3%.
For precision, the engineering team must ensure that the offsets are extremely small and kept within several millimeters on each side.
What’s comforting is that everything was implemented smoothly.
Simon Biles acquires women's individual all-around champion
Forget about stress.
Forget about speculation.
Simone Biles was unaffected by all this.
Energetic performance on the pummel horse.
Performing with ease on the balance beam.
Astounding gymnastic routines in the floor event.
The entire performance was extremely exciting.
Finally, an Olympic champion.
This 19-year-old American gymnast took the all-around gold medal on Thursday, fully displaying her unparalleled gift in gymnastics at the Olympic Games.
She won the gold by a total of 62.198, much higher than the score of the Silver winner Aly Raisman from the Final Five and Bronze Aliya Mustafina from Russia.
On Thursday, American Simone Biles performed on the balance beam for the women’s individual all-around gymnastic event at the 2016 Summer Olympic Games held at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Biles helped the US women’s gymnastic team realize four consecutive individual all-around championships at the Olympic Games. She won five medals in total at this Olympic Games, further confirming that she is the best gymnast of her generation, and perhaps even in history.
Once she saw her final score, Biles couldn’t hold back her tears. She has finally completed this long journey.
Like Michael Phelps, Biles has made it to the list of “rare athletes” who have driven their respective athletic sport to greater heights.
Biles has dominated the sport for the last 3 years, and have won a total of 15 World Championship medals, including 10 golds. Biles has set high goals for herself and trains hard everyday to reach higher levels of precision. Mary Lou Retton, Olympics champion of 1984, said: “Biles is the best gymnast I've ever seen.”
There is a final competition in Brazil, but instead of being a competition between Biles and other gymnasts, it should be regarded as a personal struggle of Biles against the stress generated by the massive expectations of her.
Everyone will be disappointed if Biles fail to return with a load of gold medals to her native home at Spring, Texas.
Simone Biles (left) and Laurie from the United States hugging each other. They respectively won the gold and silver in the women's artistic individual all-around during the 2016 Summer Olympics at Rio, Brazil, during August (Thursday).
Biles took her first gold medal on Tuesday, and will be delivering a surprising gift to Martha Karolyi, the coach of the national team who will be retiring soon.
Although Biles insisted that she has not planned for the future while dominating the world championships, the truth seems to suggest otherwise.
A segment of Biles’ floor exercise - including her marquee tumbling pass - was accompanied by Latin music, and this piece of music was precisely that which she listened to all the time at her lodging just a street away from the Arena Olímpica do Rio.
This is not a coincidence.
She was raised by her grandparents when she was a young child, and was eventually found to have great potential by the motherly coach Aimee Boorman who was conducting a inspection tour of the gym.
Since the summer of 2013, Biles had never failed in the all-around competition. As long as she wanted to, she would win.
It seems that Mustafina slight lead after her two spins is only illusory.
Simone Biles, reigning world champion of the balance beam and floor exercise, lay in wait.
She scored 15.433 on the balance beam, and 15.933 in the floor exercise.
After waiting for the final score to be provided, Raisman gave Biles a gentle hug. Biles cried when she knew she had achieved the score that she had dreamed for.
Raisman’s performance seems to be an act of vengeance for four years ago when she lost to Mustafina, who was then ranked third, during the finals game.
But this time, the 22-year old captain who has been laughably called “grandmother” by the Americans have gained a massive lead.
After the floor event, she blew a kiss to the crowd to announce her return. However, such a return look rather doubtful sometimes in the past.
Biles is just 19 years old. Since earlier this week, the news has gone viral on Twitter. For Biles, her life has taken on a whole new meaning.
“Riddled with bullets”, six-year-old Mahaj Brown survives Philadelphia shooting
Police claimed that a six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, the second time a six-year-old child was shot in the city this week.
The grandparents of the child proved to CBS Philadelphia that the child who was shot was Mahaj Brown.
They say that multiple gunshot wounds were found on Brown’s groin, legs, arms, abdomen, and other parts of his body, but the child remained conscious on the way to the hospital.
“He was hit very badly. His small body was riddled with bullets,” Delores Melendez, his grandmother, told the television station.
I couldn’t believe my eyes.
The boy is in critical condition at the hospital and has received multiple operations.
His family told the TV station that the child is expected to recover.
He was supposed to enroll in a local elementary school as a grade 1 student.
Brown is one of the four shooting victims in Germantown.
Of the other three who were shot, two were 29 years old, and one, 32.
According to CBS Philadelphia, a 29-year-old victim is in critical condition, while another two victims are in stable condition.
The television station claimed that the child and the 29-year old victim, currently in critical conditions, were found at the front seat of the vehicle.
The two other victims are not in the car. The police is investigating whether the wounded include the gunman.
Investigators told CBS Philadelphia that it seems like a shooting incident involving multiple armed persons.
Numerous assault weapon cartridges were found at the scene. It could be inferred therefore, that they had used different assault weapons.
On this basis, this will undoubtedly be a long-drawn-out conflict.
Cartridges were found on the sidewalks on both sides of the road.
“Hence, we can see that there were multiple armed personnel engaged in intense battle at the site,” Anthony Ginaldi, Police Captain of Philadelphia, told the television station.
Many houses and vehicles were damaged in this region.
The arrest has yet to be carried out. The police are reportedly looking at the surveillance video.
On Tuesday, a 6-year old child (a girl) was hit by a stray bullet on her arm while playing at the doorsteps of her home in the West Oak Lane community.
She is currently recovering. The police is still hunting for the suspect.
Why we need Simon, Gabrielle, and Laurie
This was how I evaluated the women's Olympic gymnastic team, and there is more than one reason for it.
Firstly, I have attended every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never dominated the sport as they did today.
This team of gymnasts include 3 excellent athletes: Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas, and Lauren “Laurie” Hernandez who have inspired many girls of color.
The composition of the team is something that everyone can be proud of. It includes Aly Raisman, a Jew, and Madison Kocian, a Catholic.
This team is finally starting to look like an American team.
It also strengthened the leading position of African and Latin American women in this sport.
For the last four years, the best female gymnast in the US has been an African American.
Last year, Simone and Gabrielle were ranked first and second.
That was awesome.
In the previous Olympics, Gabrielle Douglas “surprisingly” became the Olympics champion, a feat that got America cheering.
Today, the world can witness the exciting performances of three-time world champions, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Laurie Hernandez. They have elevated conventional gymnastic techniques to the highest level of artistic interpretation.
On Thursday, Simone helped the US team achieve four consecutive championships in the women’s individual all-around event.
Her teammate Aly Raisman won the silver medal.
We have ascended the zenith of this sport, but gymnastic classes throughout the entirety of the United States are not like this.
The journey that took Simon, Gabby, and Laurie into the Olympics team was similar to that experienced by Ali and Madison.
They will be the “Final Five” as the next Olympic gymnastics team will be composed of 4 athletes. This is the last year in which Marta Karolyi will be serving as the coach.
The truth is that gymnastics is an expensive sport. Gymnasts are mainly trained in private gymnastic clubs. Their parents must pay for expenses that include training, facilities, traveling, clothing, competition fees, and accommodation (including relevant expenses for the coach, gymnasts, and family members). The list of expenses is still growing.
Most sports clubs are situated in affluent neighborhoods that can provide support for this industry.
All the training of gymnasts was conducted at these clubs, which was a long-term and considerable expense for the families of gymnasts.
Aimee Boorman, Biles’ coach, and Maggie Haney, the coach of Hernandez, have coached the two gymnasts since they began training in gymnastics.
We must provide more practical and accessible gymnastic training to young girls who have been influenced by Simon, Gabrielle, and Laurie.
I founded my own gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
In my organization, we provide free and affordable gymnastics to more than 15,000 urban youths (mainly Black and Hispanic Americans) in Black neighborhoods, and have nurtured national and even world champions.
We shall expand to Detroit (my hometown) in September to provide quality gymnastics to youths who deserve this learning opportunity and could benefit from this fantastic Olympic sport.
Gymnastics helps develop physical power, flexibility, and coordination. It also helps develop perseverance, self-discipline, and determination.
These can bring lifetime benefits to a person’s health, academic and career success.
Encouraged by this team, many girls will take up gymnastics. This is wonderful.
Participation in sports carries great significance, particularly for girls.
This is an inspiring moment.
We would like to thank Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabrielle and Madison for their dazzling display of “girl power” enroute to winning the Olympic team gold medal, and we would also like to thank them for inspiring young girls from different backgrounds to unlock their path toward health, strength and success.
Junior doctors plan more strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt’s proposal
The ministers hope accepting the contract officially revised by the British Medical Association (BMA) will help end the disputes caused by the change. However, of the 37,000 junior doctors who participated in the vote, 58% opposed the contract.
In July, Mr. Hunt disclosed a plan to enforce the contract, and said that the National Health Service (NHS) of the UK is currently “in limbo”. Any delay will harm the interests of the employees and patients.
The new contract first raised the issue of altering the overnight and weekend work routines of junior doctors so as to improve nursing conditions during unsocial hours.
In a statement last night, Dr Ellen McCourt, Chairperson of BMA’s junior doctors’ committee, said, “Junior doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, particularly that it will fuel the current workforce crisis, and that it fails to treat all doctors fairly.”
Only 8 weeks are left for the first batch of doctors to sign the new contract. There isn’t much time left. We must achieve progress.
BMA is working hard to resolve the dispute through negotiations. However, nobody wished to participate. Sometimes, the government responded with silence.
Nevertheless, we’ve received a promise from Jeremy Hunt that he will keep his doors open.
“Jeremy Hunt needs to take action now, cancel the forced implementation, and resolve the “issues of concern” of the junior doctors.
If he failed to do that, the junior doctors clearly expressed that they have made the necessary preparations to take the next step of labor actions.
The previous strike occurred at late April, and delayed nearly 13,000 standard operations and 100,000 appointments as nurses and consulting physicians provided cover for doctors on the picket line.
The ministers hoped that the acceptance of the contract revised by the BMA will help resolve the dispute sparked by the changes.
BMA hopes to fight for better weekend wages for the 54,000 junior doctors concerned.
Daniel Mortimer, Chief Executive Officer of NHS Employers, called upon the Junior Doctors to stop any protest.
Mr. Mortimer said: “The effects of labor actions are extremely limited, and instead generate pressure on teams and services who are doing what they can, causing anxiety, worry, and confusion amongst patients, healthcare personnel, and their family members.”
For the last two months, we have continuously tried to negotiate with the junior doctor association, and actively responded, together with the Department of Health and other departments, of their concerns relating to their role as supervisors and disclose information.
Employers hope to continue active investigations in other key issues such as flexibility in deployment and training, providing other form of training to people who have been re-employed after a hiatus from their professional career, training costs, joint consensus for the course outlines, training vacations, and gender pay gap in the medical profession. This means that the employers place great importance on the agreement reached between the employers, Health Education England, and Department of Health and the BMA in November, February, and May.
Drug that cost 2 pounds per day can reduce risks of heart attack incidence
Relevant officials recommended promoting a GBP2 per day drug to more patients, and extending the period of taking medication. Going forward, thousands of cardiovascular patients will benefit from this drug.
Platelet aggregation inhibitor, ticagrelor, can lower the risk of a repeat heart attack among cardiac patients.
Using this drug for 12 months after a heart attack episode can help reduce recurrence of stroke or heart attack.
The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), an organization under the National Health Service (NHS) of the UK, recommended patients to keep using the drug for 4 years in order to further reduce risks of cardiovascular disease.
Now however, NHS regulator, NICE recommends that patients continue to take medication for four years so as to further lower the risk of cardiovascular diseases.
In England, about 140,000 individuals suffer from cardiac diseases, and one out of four of these individuals will suffer from recurrence in heart attack or experience a stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by plaque from the buildup of fatty substances formed on the walls of arteries.
When the plaque breaks, it will induce a thrombus and obstruct blood flow into the heart, leading to a heart attack.
If the thrombus moves, it will enter the blood stream and prevent blood flow into the brain, leading to a stroke.
A patient who had suffered a heart attack has a higher risk of another attack.
Ticagrelor (trade name Brilique) is a platelet aggregation inhibitor produced by AstraZeneca.
The NICE guidance draft issued today recommended patients take 90mg of ticagrelor for 12 months, and in the subsequent three years, 60mg of ticagrelor and two aspirins should be taken each day.
Dr. Carole Longson, director of the NICE health technology assessment center, said: “Despite having a number of effective secondary preventive treatments, more than a quarter of patients who experienced heart attack will experience another episode of heart attack or stroke, leading to devastating results.”
Fear of a relapse has a very negative impact on a person’s quality of life.
Evidence suggest that ticagrelor and aspirin, when taken together, can effectively reduce recurrence of heart conditions and risks for stroke for patients who had experienced heart attacks before.
The temporary recommendation of ticagrelor will provide more treatment alternatives for thousands of beneficiaries; for this we are deeply gratified.
However, due to the limited information on the therapeutic efficacy and safety of ticagrelor, especially the risks of bleeding, this instruction proposal does not recommend continuous use of the drug for subsequent treatment.
Computer-based culture causing rampant “electoral fraud” in Muslim Areas
Lutfur Rahman, former mayor of Tower Hamlets, was dismissed last year for corruption, prompting the publication of a government report.
The culture of “political correctness” has made electoral malpractice commonplace among the Muslim community, a harmful government report had thus revealed today.
Former cabinet minister Sir Eric Pickles accused the police, election supervision agencies, and city government for being “overly sensitive regarding racial segregation and religious issues” and turning a blind eye to evidence pointing to election abuse.
This former Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government and current anti-corruption chief said that the impact of using religious position to intimidate voters is abominable. The police should be allowed to set up cordons outside balloting stations to protect terrified voters.
He recommended that voters bring along their identity cards when they go to the polling station to prove their own identity.
At this time, voters are only required to state their name and address.
The report even suggest applying indelible ink on the fingers of voters to avoid any repeated voting.
Sir Eric said that protection for informants should be stepped up.
He called for adding channels for the media to understand documents related to the meeting and decision making processes by non-official committees or task groups.
“This not only prevents electoral fraud, it also protects local governments from being affected by the culture of rampant corruption and the dangers posed by financial fraud intimately linked to it,” he said.
Downing Street requested this report be published after the Tower Hamlets election scandal in East London occurred.
Last year, a special Election Court ruled that incumbent mayor Rahman was involved in a series of corrupt and illegal practices, and should be removed from office.
The court found that Rahman has “laughably abused” religious emotions in Muslim communities, and avoided accusations of racial discrimination and Islamophobia targeted against him.
It was said that Rahman “declared that those who vote for him are devout Muslims doing what’s needed of them by their religion.”
As many as 300 ballots appeared suspicious, and may be fraudulently cast by other voters.
Sir Eric said that there was proof that election fraud existed across the country.
In particular, he warned about postal voting fraud. It was reported that pressure was being put on voters of Muslim communities to force these voters to vote for candidates according to the will of the elders.
Sir Eric (in the picture) has put forward numerous recommendations on putting the voting mechanism in order, including bringing one’s identity card to prove one’s identity
He said in the report, “Evidence was presented of pressure being put on vulnerable members of some ethnic minority communities, particularly women and young people, to vote according to the will of the elders, especially in communities of Pakistani and Bangladeshi background.”
“Given over-sensitivity as regards ‘political correctness’ in ethnic division and religion, they are concerned that national agencies will choose to ignore such behavior.”
Sir Eric proposed 50 recommendations to sort out the voting mechanism, including banning political campaigners from handling postal ballots to prevent “vote harvesting”.
The report also called for checking registration information rigorously to prevent the electoral register from being used for immigration and welfare fraud. Theresa May is also considering this report.
These recommendations include requesting voters show their identity card before they vote.
Applying indelible ink on the fingers of voters after they vote will prevent people from double voting.
Systematically verify a voter’s nationality to ensure voting qualification.
The effective period for automatic mailing a voting request is set to three years.
The handling of postal ballots and postal ballot envelopes by political activists and radicals should be prohibited.
Authorize the police to set up cordons around the balloting stations.
Provisions of the law have been revised so that individuals can be more easily accused of intimidation in accordance with the Representation of the People Act 1983.
According to regulations, it is illegal to take photographs at the polling station.
Stipulate that only English may be used at polling stations (excluding Wales).
Training shall be stepped up to ensure that all workers enforce the regulation where “members of the electing public head to the voting booth alone”.
Sir Eric blasted the Metropolitan Police and found it to be “surprising” why they failed to push for any criminal charges after the incident at Tower Hamlets.
“Rahman and his campaign staff have committed corruption and a large number of illegal activities. His qualifications as an election candidate has therefore been revoked by the election courts,” he said.
According to criminal evidence standards, he is guilty, beyond a doubt, in many areas.
He also criticized the superficial measure of “check box inspections” of the election registration department of the city government.
Sir Eric said: “The court verdict given to Tower Hamlets is a warning sign to everyone.”
Our country has the glorious tradition as being the “mother of parliamentarism”. However, it is worrisome that certain organizations have engaged in secretive electoral fraud and tried to deny their actions afterwards. Such acts also threaten our fine reputation.
Growing fad for Rio Olympics cyclist bearing resemblance to Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, and other celebrity-lookalike athletes
At the 2016 Rio Olympic Games this week, French cyclist Pauline Frrand Prevot, Princess Kate’s doppelganger, attracted much attention among viewers.
However, this 24-year old Olympic athlete is not the only one to run into a celebrity in this Summer Olympics. At least that’s what the social media believes in.
To celebrate all celebrity faces that have appeared in the Rio Olympics and television screens at that time, FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympic athletes whose face bear close resemblance to that of Hollywood celebrities.
Hunter and the wolf: Brady Ellison (left) of the US men's archer team who has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since a young age.
In addition to the contestant on the cycling track who was Kate's doppelganger, many netizens soon discovered that a certain archer was the twin of Leonardo DiCaprio.
Ever since his photograph that bore a striking resemblance to the Wolf of Wall Street protagonist was revealed on Twitter, the American archer Brady Ellison started a massive trend in social media networks.
In fact, the archer sensed the hype in the social media and admitted that he has been said to have a "DiCaprio face" since a kid.
“I think that other than the beard, we don't look very much alike,” Brady told Huffington Post.
“He looks like a handsome playboy. I guess I should take this as a compliment.”
The "celebrity face match" popular in the 2012 London Olympic Games are even hotter this year, for example the British jumper  Greg Rutherford and the famous Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina has eyes that spoke volumes, and is said to resemble Cuban American singer Gloria Estefan.
In the swimming arena, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has always been compared with Matthew Morrison, the main singer of Glee.
Reload: This user feels that Nathan Adrian is the “sports version” of this Inception actor.
Another common comparison is the tennis star Rafael Nadal and the actor Josh Hartnett. The two bear striking resemblance thanks to their thick eyebrows and lips.
Russian swimmer Yulia Efimova who won the silver medal share the similar bronze skin tone and blond hair as actress Annalynne McCord, while Nathan Adrian of the US team has been regarded, by his fans, as the “athletic version of Joseph Gorgon Levitt”.
Heroines: Football star Hope Solo (left) and actress Jennifer Carpenter who starred in Dexter (right) have similar facial shapes and eyes.
Not one and only: A Twitter user happily discovered that others also noticed the similarities
Communication theory: According to this user, there may be a reason why the pair look alike
A Twitter user recently announced happily on the net that “other netizens also think that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter actually look exactly alike.”
Indeed, the American football star and the leading actor of Dexter shared the similar facial forms and eyes.
Other popular comparisons include Kerri Walsh Jennings, whose smile is almost similar to actress Laura Linney, as well as gold medal winning gymnast Gabby Douglas, whose beautiful and radiant smile is exactly the same as Bring It On star Gabrielle Union.
The Olympic commentator of CBS apologized for the expression that Chinese swimmers are "died like a pig".
On Wednesday, a comment made by Byron MacDonald on 14-year-old Ai Yanhan, whose team placed 4th in the women’s 4x200 meter freestyle relay angered viewers who were watching the live broadcast of the Olympic Games on Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC)
A commentator from the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) described a 14-year old Chinese swimmer as having “went out like stink” and finally “died like a pig”. CBC was later forced to apologize for this.
The commentator Byron MacDonald expressed his opinions after the completion of the 4 x 200 women’s freestyle relay, and said that he thought his microphone has already been switched off.
Viewers heard Byron, a member of the CBC team of commentators, who wore “tinted glasses” comment, “The little 14-year-old from China dropped the ball, baby.”
Too excited, went out like stink and died like a pig.
She really did a lot.
Ai Yanhan, the 14-year old Chinese swimmer, took the second leg of the relay which she completed in 1 minute 57.59 seconds, a full 1.61 seconds behind the Canadian swimmer Taylor Ruck, allowing the Canadian team to shorten their gap with the Chinese team.
Every audience in Canada was shocked by the tone and language used by the commentator. They quickly responded to this on the Internet.
Emmett Macfarlane twitted: “Did the CBC commentator say that the 14-year old Chinese swimmer was as slow as a pig?”
This idiot was not aware that he was live on air.
Ai Yanhan, the Chinese swimmer participating in the 4x200 m freestyle relay finals, was described: “That 14-year old Chinese girl made a foolish mistake.”
The criticisms leveled at Byron MacDonald quickly spread throughout Twitter. Many people asked Byron to resign from his job as commentator.
Twitter users did not stop there when they heard that Byron MacDonald has responded slowly over this incident.
Sarah Paradis, another Twitter user, wrote: “Wow! #Byron MacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada. Your words and actions make us all sound like racists.# How disgusting.
Not long after, CBC broadcaster Scott Russel apologized for Byron’s words, saying: “We apologize for the comments made about the swimmers during the live stream.”
“We are very sorry for the inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words.”
CBS has been apologized 90 times to the twitter users replied to the post.
Another commentator, Scott Russel, also apologized on behalf of Byron
CBC later copied and duplicated its apology to over 90 Twitter users who protested Byron’s explanations.
This channel quickly apologized and issued an official statement.
We are extremely sorry for what was said and that it was broadcast live.
We took action swiftly last night, and apologized to viewers who were watching our live broadcast as well as those who were following us on social media.
It should be noted that Byron’s commentary was aimed at the performance of the swimmer rather than swimmer herself.
So the choice of words was inappropriate. Byron felt deeply sorry about this.
Mike Donald tried to excuse himself by apologizing in the live show on the Thursday afternoon, saying he had zero intention of personal attack.
“I wanted to spend some time to apologize for what I said after the end of the women's relay,” he said during the CBC Olympics broadcast.
“I was merely commenting on the performance of swimmer rather than the particular individual.”
“Sorry. I mean no disrespect. I’m sorry.”
Primark customer outraged at woman who had the cheek to try on underwear in the middle of the store
A woman stripped down to try on undergarments in the middle of a store at Primark. Shocked customers don’t know where to look.
The worst part is that she even checked how she looked after wearing the underwear before taking them off and putting them back on the shelves.
She continued to peruse the shelves, and finally tried on four pieces of underwear in this store at Bouverie Place Shopping Mall in Folkestone.
The woman kept trying panties one after another without buying in the Primark shop at the Bouverie Place Shopping Center, Folkestone.
Jenny Davidson (a mother of two) was also in the shop at the time. After trying on the underwear, this mysterious woman “put on her clothes again and left the shop. She didn’t buy anything.”
She said: “Nobody believed what they just saw.”
She stood in the middle of the store, took the next underwear from the store shelf, took off her own tights and underwear, and then tried on the store underwear.
“She did not attempt to find a secluded area to try on her clothes - she just stood there; how shameless!”
"Everyone was shocked when she took off the panties again. Obviously she was not happy with it because she put it back on the shelve.
She then repeated this for three more pieces of underwear and found that none of them were to her liking. She then wore her clothes and left the store.
“She didn’t seem to mind if someone was watching her - nor think about the person who might eventually buy the piece of underwear that she had tried on.”
Ms Davidson (33 years old), a resident of Kent, said, “The thought of someone buying another person’s worn but unwashed underwear makes me sick.”
This incident occurred in a Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added: “When she left, the store assistant seems to be taking the underwear off the shelf for subsequent handling, and it was fortunate that it happened.”
“I hate it when I buy a supposedly new underwear home and found that another woman has worn it and did not wash it.”
Primark spokesperson said: “Primark is aware of the incident that occurred at the Folkestone storefront on August 9 (Tuesday).”
All contaminated products have been removed from the shelves.
How to use krav maga to protect yourself in the event of a gun attack
This world is a dangerous place, but the video on Dailymail.com may provide you with a sense of security.
We then asked master Rhon Mizrachi of the Krav Maga Federation of New York to understand how to deal with an assailant armed with a gun at close range.
It does not matter if he approaches from the front or rear. This video will teach you how to reverse such encounters to your advantage.
Mizrachi said if the gunman approaches you from the back, the first thing to do is to turn around to get a good look at the attacker and to “eliminate the line of fire”.
Then clamped the gun by forearm and shoulder, before striking the face of attacker by your elbow.
Next, hit the assailant’s groin with the knee cap. When the assailant bends over in pain, turn the gun in his hand around and hit his face with the gun barrel and the rear of the gun, making sure that the weapon is pointed at him.
If the shooter approaches from the front, use the same technique - move  your body away from the scope of the firing line, grab the gun and flip muzzle around to prevent the shooter from shooting.
At the same time, put your weight on the gun and hit the chest area of the assailant, and then turn the gun held by the assailant around so that it faces him instead.
Does it sound complicated?
Take a look at the video to see how Mizrachi actually did it.
But remember, if you're not a master of Krav Maga, the safest method to get out of a mugging situation is to hand over your cash.
A family of hooligans wrecked low-rent housing in Saltash Cornwall before being evicted
A family of miscreants who was evicted for terrorizing their neighbors vandalized their cheap rental property before leaving, causing a loss of 50,000 Sterling pounds.
After receiving a long string of complaints, Tanya Skeldon and her husband Shaun Trebilcock were evicted from their cheap rental property located at Saltash in Cornwall County.
The officials of housing association was stunned to discover the place was damaged severely after the forced evacuation.
The walls are covered with holes. The floor has been ripped up. Garbage is strewn everywhere, and there is graffiti all over the walls.
The family has been moving after the evacuation. It was said they are lodging in a private residence.
Donna McEvoy, housing manager at Cornwall Housing, said she feared the house would be beyond rescue.
She said, “For the people who live here, this is a nightmare. I don’t think people can live like that.”
There are many things that must be considered. This house may become a negative factor for Cornwall County.
This family is infamous, and their name is equally notorious.
This couple has 3 sons. They would live here every now and then. The police expressed that the household commits terror activities that include fighting in the street with baseball bats, intimidating nearby residents, drug abuse, drug dealing, shouting, arguing, and cursing.
In June, a 47-year old renter named Skeldon received a resolution for his anti-social behaviors.
Trashed-filled rooms in a house that may be demolished
Floorboards of the room where drugs were traded were lifted
Neighboring residents said that they often see them fighting in the streets, and often called the police to deal with this.
After giving an 11-week extension to voluntarily leave the place, the Cornwall County Residential Authority forcibly evicted her and her husband from their residence this week.
Neighbors who finally breathed a sign of relief cheered because of this. They said that life in the past was a living hell.
A neighbor said: “They don't care about anyone.”
We lived next to them for 20 years. It’s been terrible all this time.
We have seen the police come by many times.
“We couldn’t sleep this morning.”
We woke up early because it was just too quiet. We are not used to this yet!
They finally left. Thank goodness.
Cornwall Housing's neighborhood enforcement manager Adam Fitzpatrick said that this family failed to cooperate with the local government.
The family lived in this house for 20 years and has been frequented by the police
Rubbish and old toys are thrown at the side of the low-rent housing project where weeds are overgrown
He added: “What is disappointing is that the tenant did not bear any responsibility for the actions that she and her family members have committed. Eviction is the final measure considered by the Cornwall residence committee.”
This is a very difficult case to handle because their behavior was rather extreme. What they did must have terrified the neighbors.
I thank my team for the work they have done. I also want to thank the Devon and Cornwall Police as well as members of the community who have courageously provided us with information.
I hope that this act will bring some comfort to the neighborhood, and transmit this message: We shall not tolerate anti-social behavior.
Mr. Fitzpatrick expressed that their three sons have lived in this house at different times, but he also added that they're only in their twenties.
After they were evicted, a dirty mattress was left on the floor of one of the bedrooms
Housing association workers swiftly cleaned up heaps of garbage around the house
In 2014, police had searched this house and found more than 70 grams of marijuana, as well as scales, drug kits and GPB1,700 in cash.
After pleading guilty, Skeldon was fined for possession of Class B drugs and intent to traffick drugs.
She claimed that the money would be used to buy a headstone for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
From our understanding, after losing her home, Tanya and her husband is now residing at a private house at Plymouth.
Graffiti littered the walls of many of the rooms in this residence.
The police expressed that they will evict any tenant who violate the tenants’ rule of conduct.
Angela Crow of the police department of Devon and Cornwall said that this eviction will send a clear warning to tenants who continue to violate the tenants’ code of conduct.
“This warning is directed as those who think that nobody will complain about their behaviors, and for people who were victimized by such behaviors,” she said.
Police departments of Devon and Cornwall tolerate zero criminal and anti-social activity. They will continue protecting our community with partners.
Reid: Hilary would pick Garland as nominee for the Supreme Court if she was elected president
Harry Reid, the Democratic Party leader in the United States Senate, said that he believes that if the Democratic Party presidential candidate Hillary Clinton becomes the President, she will nominate Merrich Garland to the Supreme Court.
Since Barack Obama nominated Garland, Republican senators have constantly refused to ratify Garland’s nomination.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell expressed that the next President will select this person to replace Antonin Scalia, the late Justice of the Supreme Court.
Reed said, during a teleconference on Thursday, that he expects Hillary to select Garand, which is “somewhat reliable”.
A spokeswoman for Reid said subsequently that Reid did not speak to Hilary directly about whether she would nominate Garland, and said that he was just guessing.
He praised Garland profusely, and said that Hillary’s team did not wish to “make a mess” because of the new candidate.
Garland is the  Chief United States Circuit Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Reid said that Republicans blocking Garland’s nomination are Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s “minions” and “enablers”.
He said Trump is not President-type.
Treats: A nude calendar “both men and women will love”
Treats magazine will be working with photographer David Bellemere to create a 2017 calendar inspired by Pirelli designs of 1970s.
They plan to seek a new generation of top models for their 2017 NU Muses calendar rather than use famous nudes this time round.
Treats magazine publisher Steve Shaw expressed earlier today that their magazine which features nudes primarily, is different from the old style Playboy magazine because “the latter is directed at men”.
And we are facing the women.
Apparently, he believes that these diaries are the same as well.
“We need to display lasting and classic nudes that make men and women feel comfortable, and it was precisely this that inspired us,” Shaw said at a briefing to promote the calendar.
Women enjoyed participating in this  shoot because it was a beautiful piece of artwork.
Models may apply by submitting their photos online. They may also apply in person at the open recruitment centers in Los Angeles and New York.
Video report: The small-headed sleeper shark is the longest-living vertebrate.
Scientists indicate that the Greenland shark is a vertebrate with the longest lifespan on Earth.
Julius Nielsen, who has always been studying sharks, said that according to recorded data, there is a female small-headed sleeper shark with an age of 272 to 512 years and a body length of up to 5 meters.
French court rejects petition to dismantle shops in the Jungle refugee camp
A French court rejected the proposal of the Calais government aiming to dismantle dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the refugee “jungle”. Over a thousand refugees currently reside within this camp.
During the court hearings of this week, the Calais government argued that the French government has the right to dismantle a total of 72 temporary shops and establishments within the refugee camp. At these stores located within the refugee camps, people could sell cigarettes, energy drinks, and other merchandise, provide haircuts, and even sell tea at 50 US cents (40 pence) or a basic meal for several Euros at temporarily constructed restaurants.
The Calais prefect’s office believed that these places should be dismantled because they were a non-tax paying parallel economy. They were also fire and hygiene risks.
However, humanitarian groups expressed to the court that these stores and restaurants are especially important because the free food provided by associations sponsored by public agencies and other groups is unable to meet the needs of the growing number of refugees within the camp.
They claimed that these shops and restaurants that are temporarily constructed are to provide shelter and free food for the needy.
A court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis for evicting the operators of the 72 temporary stores but said that the concern of the governor of Calais was “completely understandable”.
Judge Jean·François Molla said that the role of these grocery stores, cafés and restaurants were far from simply providing food to the refugees who were “living in extremely precarious conditions".
He said that some places are peaceful gathering locations for refugees and volunteers.
One of the areas threatened with dismantling is the Jungle Book Kids coffee house in the refugee camp. This non-profit vendor provides 200 meals a day, lessons in English and French, and provide sheltering consultation for hundreds of underprivileged youths within the refugee camp.
More than 170,000 individuals signed a petition to preserve the coffee house.
In a letter to the Guardian, closing this coffee house “will be a major disaster to these children (many of whom are only eight years old).”
The two charity organizations of Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of refugees in the Jungle refugee camp has reached 9,000, the highest figure on the records since the number of refugees exploded after summer.
The UK team won a silver medal while the Fijian team won the gold medal in rugby sevens.
During the final game of rugby sevens in Thursday evening, the UK team was unable to sustain their outstanding performance before the Fijians and was defeated by the Fijian team at the Rio Deodoro Stadium with a score of 43 to 7.
The Fijian team demonstrated impeccable performance in ball control, interception, dodging, teamwork, running, and power, taking the gold medal they deserve. This is also the country’s first Olympic gold in history.
For the defeated British team, the silver medal offered some consolation. This silver medal was the third silver medal received by the British team that day. This accomplishment was enough to make the British rugby team feel proud: The first time they took part in the rugby sevens at the Olympic Games, they defeated New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
Earlier that day, the UK team defeated the South African team with a slight margin of 7 to 5. This may affect their status in the finals.
Regardless, the current Fijian team is capable of defeating any 15-member rugby team with high morale.
Tomorrow, at least one British national will be wearing a gold medal. This may or may not be a form of consolation for the UK team. This British national is the head coach of the Fijian team, Ben Ryan. He was once the head coach of the British team.
The results Britain obtained today was not easy.
Eight years ago, coached by Ryan, they failed to win at the Adelaide IRB Sevens World Series.
Now they are only one step to champion.
Despite being severely affected, they managed to achieve surprising improvements.
Fiji dominated from the very beginning; the British team could barely hold its own.
For Tom Mitchell and his teammates, it was like hitting a row of buses on the move. When Osea Kolinisau rushed into the corner flag section, this world series champion was already leading comfortably at 5-0.
Jerry Tuwai scored a touch down on the right wing just 4 minutes into the match.
12 to 0. The UK team almost didn’t touch the ball at all.
Michael’s powerful tackle prevented the colossal Leone Nakarawa from making his third point. However, this only delayed the Fijian’s speed in scoring another goal.
At the 7th minute, Jasa Veremalua touched down in the right corner. 17=0; it was one disaster after another for the British team.
Nacarava scored another point, and there was still 1 minute left in the first half of the match ........
Then Vatemo Ravouvou broke through the England defense, and scored.
During half-time, the score is already 29 to 0.
Playing Rugby Sevens seemed second nature to Fijians. The British team, on the other hand, are still fledglings.
Such is the situation.
The UK team made drastic changes for the second half of the game and hurled themselves at the Fijian defenses for four minutes. This performance was, when compared to the first half, rather impressive. However, the Fujian team demonstrated fantastic teamwork, with Josua Tuisova scoring another touchdown.
Dan Norton created a scoring opportunity for Great Britain. He touched own on the left corner and changed the score to 36-7, but the match had long been within the control of the South Sea Island nation. Their fans were signing, waving flags, and dancing in the stands.
The exciting performance given by the Fijian team was to be applauded.
Mata Viliame prevented an indifferent attack by the Fiji team at the last moment.
When the final whistle was blown, the Fijians got together in a big hug while the UK team left the field in defeat.
Earlier today, the Fijian team defeated the Japanese team in the semi-finals with a score of 20 to 5. The UK, on the other hand, won a victory by a very slim margin after a grueling semi-finals game.
In the first half of the game, Kyle Brown helped the South African team achieve a lead, but Dan Norton and his impressive footwork managed to break through the defenses to score a point in the second half.
Afterwards, Marcus Watson, a brother of Anthony, of the UK team secured the team’s victory with an impressive interception, allowing the UK to win the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning, encouraged by their coach who was afflicted with cancer, won the gold medal for the sculls event.
It isn’t an overstatement to describe this as the most emotional gold medal.
Since they started rowing, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have received 220 sessions of punitive pulling training. The gold medal they won at Estacio da Lagoa is especially meaningful for them.
Although there were only two rowers on the boat, there was another presence, that of their coach Robin Williams, whose voice accompanied them in their charge to achieve their second Olympic gold medal in the women’s double sculls. The women are the first British pair to win a women’s sculls event at such level.
They have defended a record of 39 consecutive victories and enjoy definitive advantage.
You witnessed the two talent swimmer sliding gracefully across the surface. But it is not  what the victory all about.
There are many volunteer supporters behind a rowing metal who made difference by their devotions. The most helpful hand was the coach who did not expect witness the victory day because he was diagnosed of cancer 30 months before.
Just as he said, death strikes at any time.
I had bladder cancer, and went for surgery.
If the operation is not implemented, the cancer cells will spread throughout the entire body.
The situation will be a lot worse this way.
This will slightly change your views.
Williams was diagnosed with cancer in December 2013.
Fortunately, after initiating treatment in early 2014, he was able to minimize the effects to the minimum. However, it may be inappropriate to describe it as such under such circumstances.
I must get paid, so I must get better as quickly as possible.
This was an incentive for me.
I live in the hospital. Although they say taking a few steps is enough, I would walk 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet around the ward every time.
This was the origin of all things.
Rowing is a journey in and of itself, and this has made the journey somewhat longer.
They thought about Williams first when the gold metal was secured. Williams was a little bit more talkative this morning, a way to get rid of his anxiety.
Once a captain of the Royal Regiment of Artillery, Stanning will go to Afghanistan later. She said, “I was out of sorts this week, perhaps a little extreme, but the significance of this gold medal is extraordinary.”
It repeatedly told me how important this is, how much Helen, Robin, and I have dedicated ourselves to this.
These are the returns Helen, Robin and I have worked hard for for the last three years.
If not for Luo Bin, we would still be nobodies. We are very grateful to him. He is the best coach in the world.
I couldn’t possibly have found a trainer and coach better than him.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have been undefeated for five years.
Their opponents prove to be unable to withstand the punishing power of this combination.
Although the New Zealand and Denmark teams began to close in in the 500 meters, Stanning and Glover still had massive physical reserves.
It was extremely thrilling.
"Keep the beat, the beat!" Helen screamed.
It is very important to not be influenced by your opponent.
We had a very good start, and did not expect to do anything earth-shattering.
We didn't think of the glory we won today. We only thought about making every row count and winning the competition, and we did just that.
This combination took a year to decide its future.
Glover will be marrying Steve Backshall, a television explorer, next month.
But now she is only interested in enjoying the good times.
I don’t want to say that this is my last match.
This will give me too much pressure.
In London, I spent about 6 months before I realized that I’m a Olympic champion.
This is a brand new expereince, and I’m very nervous.
Approximately 4 minutes have passed.
She expressed: “I feel much better.”

The “anime” effect of Snapchat is being accused of making fun at Asians.
Snapchat expressed that anime has served as an inspiration for this filter. Some observers, however, believe that it has racist undertones.
The 150 million active users of Snapchat can use the filter to change the real image into a hilarious and funny face.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, dog, or a character in a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
with a effects of passivation and curving, the filter was used by more than 30million selfies a day.
Any mistake will be a focal point for the general public.
The Snapchat filter was criticized before for encouraging blackface antiques or providing fairer skin for beauty effects.
Therefore, when it was said that this week should be used to provide some users with filters that could create the effects of slanted eyes, buckteeth and pink face, some critics have called this a racist caricature of “yellow skinned” Asians.
They even believed that the recurrence of these events is a sign that there are major diversity issues within this company.
Snapchat expressed that after removing this function, the Wednesday report on The Verge and Motherboard has led to public fury.
The company’s explanation is: this filter is a tribute to anime characters, not a jibe at Asians.
For an observer who has experienced racism, this filter reminded them of harmful stereotypes that occur in real life.
Others also firmly opposed these anime caricatures.
With respect to the posting of these photographs on Twitter and repeated sharing, a Korean American art student expressed in an e-mail that these filters are: “Annoying and discomforting.”
She also said:" It is difficult to distinguish the extremely disgusting ironic image of Asian and the filter effect."
Although the filter does not just include East Asians, these people have been subject to extreme ridicule.
Snapchat was not the only company to have tested the cultural bottom line.
From the company’s board meeting to Hollywood, and the equipment we brought, the American culture seems to promote diversity and tolerance.
Snapchat’s large population of young users are more focused on racial diversity compared to the older generation, and may be extremely sensitive to this.
When a Snapchat filter produced an image that insulted a user, 25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview on Thursday, “In the past, this sort of thing would not have easily eluded people.”
On Thursday, Madam Zhu, who is a product manager and engineer at Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and encouraged others to do so as well.
In  an article for Medium and in a telephone interview, she said that she believed that the racial controversy reflected a lack of ethnic diversity in Snapchat’s hiring process.
Zhu criticized that most employees of this company are white men, that upper management are all men, and added a hashtag at the back of her post: #DeleteSnapchat.
As a Chinese American, Mdm Zhu expressed: “Either that they have no colored employees which made this decision possible, or that they have colored employees but their job titles prevent them from voicing their opinions.”
Other observers shared her complaint for not receiving a response from Snapchat
This Company has yet to publish information on employee diversity, and expressed that they are a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the ethnic backgrounds of its staff, but a spokesperson said that the company had recently hired a recruiter to focus primarily on groups that comprise a lower proportion of the company, and to work on promoting inclusiveness within the company.
Madam Zhu said that she will close her Snapchat account, “I want to know if they need more users like us who oppose this sort of behavior.”
House panel says military officers distorted ISIS intelligence
A report issued by a congressional panel on Thursday revealed that US Central Command officials altered intelligence reports to portray a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than events on the ground warranted.
This mid-term report is prepared by a special task force established by the United States House Committee on Armed Services, House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, and Republication Party chairperson of the House Appropriations Defense Subcommittee. The report claimed that “displeasure is common” amongst intelligence analysts of the United States Central Command. These analysts expressed that their superiors are changing their assessments regarding the war between the United States and the Islamic State.
The United States Central Command (Centcom), located at Tampa in the State of Florida, is a military headquarter responsible for monitoring US military activities in the Middle East and Central Asia regions.
According to news about this report, “intelligence review by high ranking leadership of the United States Central Command gave more optimistic descriptions for US counter-terrorism activities compared to actual situations. The review was also more optimistic compared to analyses carried out by other intelligence agencies.”
Republican Party representative of the state of California expressed: “The actions of the United States Central Command is hard to accept. Our soldiers are suffering and bearing the brunt of the war while higher ups making the policies are receiving wrong analysis.”
Leadership issues have spread to the highest echelons of the US Central Command.
The report gave detailed descriptions and analysis of the United States Central Command in 2014 and 2015 for long-term issues regarding US training provided to the Iraqi armed forces.
Although there was no clear evidence to show that senior officials of the Obama administration ordered the reports to be altered, the report said that these analysts felt that they were under pressure from Central Command leaders to portray a more optimistic view of threats from the Islamic State (ISIS or ISIL).
The report claimed that “in the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and congressional testimonies were significantly more positive than actual events.”
For example, a Centcom official stated publicly that a major military assault to take back Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city of Iraq, is currently under the control of the Islamic State.
Kansas Republican Representative Michael Pompeo said in a statement, “After months of investigation, this much is very clear.”
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, most senior intelligence officials of the United States Central Command manipulated intelligence products of the Command and covered up threats posed by the Islamic State of Iraq.
After Republicans learned from analysts that information on the Islamic State was manipulated, they formed a special taskforce.
Along with ongoing investigation, more findings will be forthcoming following the issuance of Thursday’s report.
The General Counsel of the Department of Defense conducted a long-term investigation of the Central Command.
Democrat members of the US House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence reported the results of the investigation on Thursday. The results were consistent with parts of the conclusion reached by the Republican Party task force.
Adam Schiff, the committee’s Democratic Party leader said in a statement, “Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an overly insular process for producing intelligence assessments on ISIL and Iraqi Security Forces.”
Mr Xie Anda said that this process “hindered intelligence disclosure”, lowered the morale of analysts, and “rejected different opinions.”
Adam Schiff and the democrats also expressed that they did not find any evidence proving the White House tried to press on analysts in the Central Command. It's a way to fit their conclusion with the " preset or political story".
On Tuesday, The Daily Beast reported the results of preliminary investigations by the Congress.
Last August, The New York Times reported that the Inspector General of the Pentagon has initiated investigations after receiving complaints from the United States Central Command analysts.
Pentagon spokesperson Navy Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans said in a statement that the Department of Defense will refrain from making any comments on the congressional report until after the Attorney General has concluded its investigation.
However, he said, “Experts sometimes disagree when it comes to interpretation of complex data, and intelligence agencies and the Ministry of National Defense encourage healthy dialogue on these important national security topics.”
The impact of this investigation has already surpassed the issue of whether the bombing of Iraq and Syria led by the US would be successful (as claimed by an increasing number of Department of Defense officials).
Last year however, these assertions have caused the public to question the extent to which President Obama can trust the assessment for military action issued by the Central Common on Iraq, Afganistan, Libya and other areas of crisis.
The critiques on the Islamic State intelligence mirror disputes of more than a decade ago, when a Centcom intelligence analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a research paper saying that the administration of President George W. Bush, over many analysts’ objections, advocated a small force in Iraq and spent little time thinking about what would follow the 2003 invasion.
Mr. Hooker played an important role in opposing the incident regarding the Islamic State intelligence.
Last year, an official expressed that the conclusion reached by Mr. Hook’s team is that air strikes launched against oil refinery facilities of the Islamic State failed to drastically reduce the economic income of the terrorist organization as they had constructed a temporary refinery and continued to sell oil on the black market. This was greatly different from the published statement.
According to a September report in Time magazine, the US Central Command did not disclose this finding to the public.
When numerous lawyers reviewed the overly optimistic assessments regarding the war within the testimony given to the Senate, Commander Lloyd James Austin III of the US Central Command came under intense criticisms.
General Austin retired from military service in April, and his position as commander of United States Central Command has been succeeded by Joseph Votel.
The US has acquired four consecutive wins in the women's hockey game, and will be facing the UK to determine who’s the victor.
Katie Bam, who scored a hat trick in 6-1 victory over Japan, helped the USA women’s field hockey team defeat India 3-0 on Thursday by scoring two goals.
Having scored 5 goals in 2 games and astounding the audience with her skills, Bam, currently 27 years old, expressed that she was unaware that her performance has garnered such attentions.
She said, “I haven’t the faintest idea.”
I am not someone who would remember how many goals I scored.
She knew that the American team has achieved 4 consecutive victories in the Olympics, and will be playing against the UK team for the first position in the division. The UK team has just defeated the Japanese team on Thursday with a score of 2 to 0.
The UK and the US will face each other in the first round of the competition on Saturday.
Both teams are in quarterfinal. It is the match for group winner.
The team that achieves the first place in the group will be able to avoid the much stronger Netherlands team and go further in this event. The Netherlands team has emerged as the first place in another group.
During the competition on Saturday, the American team astounding performance achieved a miracle. Just four years ago at the London Olympics, the American team was given the lowest ranks of the 12 teams.
Bam was in that team at the time.
Bam grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and picked up a hockey stick for the first time when she was three years old (her older twin sisters are field hockey players at Drexel). She joined the national team at 16, and is to date, the youngest member of the national team.
She missed out on the 2008 Olympic Games because she failed to make the shortlist.
In 2012, both she and her teammates were regarded as underdogs.
During the second year, when Craig Panam from Britain became the main coach, everything started to change.
Bam said, “This was a cultural, mindset and substantive change.”
Our standards back at London have yet to reach our current level.
We were able to achieve a complete reversal.
On Thursday night, Bam delivered a backhand shot at close range to score the first goal in the first half.
India has yet to achieve victory in this Games, but the team has demonstrated amazing determination and kept the score at 1:0 until nearly the end of the third quarter. This was when Bam started the rampage.
She brought the ball along the left of the field for a long distance charge before cutting inwards to the center, delivering a shot that sent the ball into the goal, allowing the US team to gain a lead with 2:0.
Melissa Gonzalez scored the last goal in the middle of the fourth quarter.
US goalkeeper Jaclyn Briggs shutout the opposition with the first clean sheet of the season. In the previous three wins, she let in one goal each.
This time, she put on an extraordinary performance.
Bam too.
Panum said, “We’re in good form right now”, but exactly how good would depend on the outcome of Saturday's match.
Miserable fare during the Great Depression in The Big Feast
In March 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who was just elected as the President of the United States, was sitting in the presidential office enjoying lunch.
As a gourmet, President Roosevelt loved fancy foods from Fifth Avenue such as foie gras and Maryland terrapin soup.
His menu was very simple that day: deviled eggs with ketchup, mashed potatoes and preserved fruit pudding as dessert.
Jane Zigman said: “This is to show solidarity with people who are suffering as a result of food-related issues.”
Her husband Andrew Cole added: “This also reflected the American food culture.”
The couple who lives at Brooklyn Heights are both food historians.
Mr Coe’s previous book, Chop Suey, was about Chinese cuisine in America, while Ms Ziegelman’s 97 Orchard tells the story of the lives of tenants living in the ghetto through food.
The new book titled A Square Meal that the two jointly authored will be published by Harper on Tuesday. The book introduces the history of American food during the Great Depression.
After demonstrating some consensual understanding about food, they met a reporter at a sandwich shop at Eisenberg. This simple lunch eatery at the Flatiron District has been in business since the economic depression of 1929.
54-year-old Ms Ziegelman ordered a cream cheese and crushed olive sandwich, while 57-year-old Mr Coe ordered a turkey, mashed potato and vegetable set.
The reporter ordered a meatloaf. This couple felt that this meal was appropriate for discussing food during the Great Depression.
Ziegelman said: “Bread was very popular at that time.”
There was peanut bread, liver bread and soybean bread at the time.
They are all made from a particular raw material, and a cheap topping that can be poured onto the raw material.
Just imagine for a moment that peanuts are all you are going to have for dinner.
Mr. K made a face.
He said: “They definitely feel like lead in your stomach.”
Americans enjoy buffet meals everyday, especially in suburb areas several years before the Great Depression.
A group of women is responsible for preparing the meals for the male farmhands. There are baked pies for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
During WWI, Americans sent food to hungry Europeans. The Big Feast recorded how this country was suddenly no longer a land of plenty.
Mr Coe explained why he and his wife wanted to write this book. “At the time, food had become a major topic that made Americans unhappy.”
Another unwelcome topic is the poor state of new food: “Mysterious food” comprising bread and stewed vegetables have become the entrée. Stewed vegetables is the “best way to cook leftovers,” as explained by Ziegelman as chefs can use cream within the sauce to cover up the taste of poor-tasting ingredients.
Fresh fruits are being replaced by cheaper dried fruit preserves.
For many years, meat, once a staple part of the American dinner table, has become a rare luxury item.
This strange mish-mash seems to be focused solely on calories instead of taste or even basic cooking techniques. The people are primarily concerned with nutrition.
In the course of researching this book, including various recipes, Ms Ziegelman made a roasted onion stuffed with peanut oil.
Mr Coe said, “This is not a common sight at the dinner table.”
Ziegelman expressed: “This is really odd.”
Pairing peanut oil with roasted onions is simply out of the question.
This is a feature of many family budget meals.
Home economists have influenced the dietary habits of this country. For example, Louis Stanley served as the Chief of the Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943. Such personalities are unique in history.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines encouraging women to “act in an economic way” and bravely combine carbonara with carrots and other food with lower grade to make something delicious.
A Square Meal provides a sumptuous historical feast.
The response of the government to the starving public worthed pondering, for example " It's other's business" attitude by the President Herbert Hoover
Although he openly praised the simple Iowa farmstead of his childhood, his diet was as exquisite as a millionaire’s meal.
Mr Coe said, “He liked to eat Continental cuisine, like fish with cucumber sauce.”
He is wearing an evening suit and having dinner at a gold-plated restaurant.
He is clearly detached from the people.
If not for wife Eleanor’s encouragement to set an example in respect of his diet, President Roosevelt may also have made the same mistake.
As was said in this book, the housekeeper Mrs Roosevelt hired had no interest in taste. Therefore, the White House “not only had the worst food in Washington, it also had the worst prepared food.”
When the US returned to normal, many methods of cooking during the Great Depression were abandoned.
Miss Zigman expressed that the remaining is our concern for calories and nutrition as well as scientific applications in cooking.
This couple expressed that when writing the book, they achieved further understanding of the culinary habits of Ziegelman’s mother, such as her unwillingness to throw any food away.
Mr Coe said, “She dreads wasting food.”
Ms Ziegelman recalled, “In fact, she made a lot of people sick.”
Another incidence that occurred was the “cream puff” event.
After taken away the dishes, Mr. K and she presented a home-made dessert, or the dried fruit pudding President Roosevelt enjoyed during the lunch.
Ziegelman said: “This is called cream conserve.” She then gave this common dish a trendy name of: “Old Tricks”.
This dessert does not contain whipped cream, only preserved fruit, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctantly dipped their spoons deep into the dense brown paste.
This dessert tastes surprisingly good.
Mr Ko ate a second spoonful, and a third spoonful.
He felt that this was an acceptable and affordable dessert, and told his wife, “It’d taste better if chopped walnuts were added.”
Gilead wins attorney fees in its hepatitis C patent battle against Merck
A US District Court judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc was entitled to receive legal fees it incurred in the hepatitis C patent litigation with pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, after discovering illegal activities committed by Merck, including false testimony and other unethical behaviors, the American judge ruled that Gilead is exempt from a 200 million USD compensation claim by Merck who charged that Gilead has infringed its two patents through sales of its popular drug sofosbuvir and harvoni.
During court proceedings on Thursday, US District Judge Beth Labson Freeman expressed that Gilead is not required to pay for expenses it incurred to defend its claims.
Merck is attempting to catch up with Gilead which has dominated the new generation hepatitis C pharmaceutical market. Gilead’s drug can treat more than 90% of hepatitis patients.
The case could be traced back to 2013 at the earliest when both Gilead and Merck charged each other. Both claimed themselves to be the owner of the lab work for sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead’s pharmaceutical product.
US-backed troops announced that they have recaptured Manbij from ISIS
A military spokesperson expressed on Friday that the remaining Islamic State fighters have completely withdrawn. US-backed forces have gained complete control over the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border.
Now that radicals hiding in the city have left, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are conducting a crackdown of the entire city.
Sharfan Darwish of the Manbij Military Council of the Syrian Democratic Forces told Reuters that they have rescued over 2,000 civilians who were abducted by extremists.
He told Reuters: “The entirety of Manbij is currently under our control, but we’re still implementing sweeps.”
The Clintons have an income of 10.75 million USD for 2015, and paid a Federal Tax of 34.2%.
On Friday, Hillary Clinton disclosed her tax returns of 2015. The document showed that the Democratic Party Presidential Candidate and her husband received an income of 10.75 million USD in 2015, and paid a federal tax of 34.2%.
In 2015, the Clintons gave 1 million US dollars as charitable donations, most of which were donated to The Clinton Foundation. Former President Bill Clinton’s speech fees amounted to nearly 5.30 million dollars, while the former Secretary of State received an income of 3.00 million dollars from the publisher Simon & Schuster for her book about her job at the Department of State.
Clinton’s running mate, US Senator from Virginia Tim Kaine and his wife Anne Holton, publicly disclosed their tax returns for the last 10 years.
The two paid 20.3% Federal tax in 2015.
Clinton’s running mate Jennifer Palmieri expressed in another statement: Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine shall continue to serve as beacons of financial transparency.”
In contrast, Donald Trump has used fake excuses as a cover up, and retracted his previous promise to release his tax returns.
Although not legally required, it is customary for US presidential candidates to disclose their tax returns to the public.
As a New York businessman, Trump and his lawyer have used the audit by the US Internal Revenue Service as an excuse to refuse to publicly disclose his tax returns.
Clinton's campaign staff Ian Sams expressed on Twitter that the people should decide, and provided links to the tax returns of the Democratic Party presidential candidate.
On Thursday, Michael Cohen, special legal counsel to Donald Trump, told the CNN that he will not allow Trump to disclose his tax returns before the audit is completed.
People who criticize Trump include the 2012 Republican Party presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republicans who expressed that Trump’s refusal to publish his tax returns will lead to doubts regarding his net assets, charitable donations, business transaction, and other relationships, including his relationship with Russia.
Clinton took aim at this issue, and released an online video on Friday, highlighting high-profile Democrats urging Trump to publicly release his tax returns.
In Michigan State on Thursday, she mentioned this issue in a speech on economic policy.
She told the people: “For decades, he has refused to publish his tax returns as other presidential candidates had done before him.”
Politico reported that Trump paid virtually no tax for two years in the 1990s. New York Times business columnists quoted many tax lawyers and accountants on Friday. They said that this may well be the case at this time.
Federal tax has become a major issue for presidential elections.
Clinton named a rule after billionaire Warren Buffett, which ensured that a minimum tax rate of 30% will be applied on people who earned more than US$1 million in income.
President Obama also supported this proposal.
Last week, Clinton held a gathering at Omaha, Nebraska, the home of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. At the gathering, Warren Buffett asked for a meeting with Trump and to exchange tax returns.
Buffet said that he is also being audited by the IRS at this time. What Trump is “afraid of” is not the tax authorities but voters.
The earliest tax return Clinton’s election team disclosed was that of 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average Federal tax rate of approximately 32%, and a combined tax rate of about 40.5% between 2007 and 2014.
Tax returns of the Clintons in 2015 showed that, unlike most Americans, they only received a salary of only 100 US dollars.
Their primary investment is in a low-cost index fund, and the dividend and interest income Mr and Mrs Clinton received amounted to US$109,000.

Jewish filmmaker criticizes Berlin hotel for removing Israel’s dial code upon “request” by an Arab guest - Reuters
A French filmmaker of Jewish origin told the media that the Kempinski Hotel in Berlin did not list Israel’s dial code, and a hotel employee said that this was in accordance with a “request” made by an Arab customer. This triggered a public outcry.
Claude Lanzmann, the author of Shoah, a documentary film about the Jewish Holocaust, expressed his disappointment in Kempinski hotel and wrote an open letter that was posted on the German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.
When he last checked-in, Lanzmann wanted to find Israel in the list of telephone dialing codes provided by the hotel.
But Israel is not in the country list available for in-room direct dialing
How did Israel disappeared from the 2016 German capital of Berlin?
Lanzmann wrote.
In replacement, guests can now use the Kempinski Hotel call center to make a call to Israel.
To search for an explanation, this film producer asked the hotel receptionist.
Lanzmann wrote in the letter that the answer he got at the front desk was " shocking".
Hotel staff expressed that “this was a deliberate decision made by the management of Kempinski Hotel”.
The reason for doing that was to infuriate the filmmaker.
Lanzmann quoted what this employee said, “The majority of our guests are Arabs and they demanded Israel’s code to be deleted.”
According to the Süddeutsche Zeitung, the Israeli ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, treated this event as a “great shame”.
We were shocked when we found out about this.
This is a huge shame in itself.
The incident that occurred in Germany and the franchise hotel was shameless.
This matter does not require further explanations.
“We hope that this Hotel can provide an accurate conclusion,” the official expressed.
This matter triggered an intense debate on the Internet. Everyone thought it was scandalous.
Some people felt that the Kempinski Hotel “groveled” just to keep the Arab customer happy.
Another post said that the hotel is “shameless” and pointed out that the famous Kurfürstendamm that the establishment was located is next to a synagogue.
Der Spiegel reported that the hotel swiftly clarified all accusations. It claimed that it was all due to “negligence”, and “apologized” to Lanzmann.
Süddeutsche Zeitung quoted a Kempinski representative as saying, “There was never a direct order to remove Israel from the fast dial list.”
This paper also claimed that the dial code of Israel has been added to the list.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse the protesting Brazilian students.
On Thursday, at São Paulo Brazil, students clashed with the police while protesting against the government over public educational system reform.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse the protesters.
This incident was triggered by law enforcement officers attempting to disperse the students. Therefore, the police used rubber bullets and tear gas.
Hundreds of students took part in the protest to express their dissatisfaction with these plans.
To save funds, Governor Alckmin of the State of São Paulo made plans to shut down 100 public schools. A total of 300,000 students will be transferred elsewhere.
Some students who took part in the protest expressed their dissatisfaction with interim president Michel Temer by drawing graffiti on the wall.
Just a few days before the latest protest, the protesters took the to street in force to support President Dilma Rousseff who had been impeached by the Senate of the country.
Scottish cyclist Callum Skinner returns in glory after clinching gold in cycling
Last night at the Rio Olympic Velodrome, the Scottish cyclist Callum Skinner helped the UK 3-men team successfully defend their Olympic gold medal in the men’s team sprint that they had achieved during the 2012 London Olympics.
This 23-year-old cyclist from Glasgow replaced his fellow Scot - Sir Chris Hoy - and anchored the team. When young Skinner defeated the New Zealand team, the top title contender, and returned victorious, even this cycling legend was proud of him.
Four years ago, the UK team achieved astounding performance with Hoy receiving the fifth gold medal in his personal collection of six Olympic golds.
The UK team only placed sixth at the UCI Track Cycling World Championships held in London in March. Hoy retired after that. The UK team has since regained glory.
Between the Beijing Olympic Games and the London Olympic Games, the problem with the Great Britain team was in replacing Jamie Staff, the “first lap expert”.
The motorcade started doing so when Hinds appeared.
Hoy’s retirement also left a vacuum which Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton would like to fill.
After witnessing Skinner’s potential, the coach of the men’s team of the UK insisted upon making him a part of the national team. Skinner also lived up to the expectations.
Skinner’s partners are Hindes and Kenny who won the gold medal 4 years ago with Hoy. The 3 men broke the Olympic record in the qualifiers, but the achievement was surpassed in the first round by the New Zealand team.
These three English cyclists defeated their opponents ultimately and won the gold medal.
Although Hinds is slightly behind, Kenny was able to help the team gain a lead. Skinner maintained the lead all the way till the end.
A change in strategy was key to this reversal. Hindes chose a larger flywheel so that he could slow down, thus enabling Kenny, and Skinner, in particular, to keep pace.
When Hoey watched the game as the BBC commentator, Skinner, Kenny and Hindes saw him when ascending the podium.
23-year-old Glasgow cyclist Skinner said, “I’m extremely flattered.”
I’m doing what I can to establish my reputation.
We have set an Olympic record in the finals and defeated the world champions.
This is too unbelievable.
There is nothing better than this victory.
After Kenny and Hoy claimed gold medals at the 2012 London Olympic Games, Skinner admitted that he fell on the track on purpose because he started poorly.
He later retracted these comments. The opponents of the UK team were unable to press any charges.
And this victory did not have any of these issues.
Hindes said, “This is just like London. The podium was decked with Union Jacks.”
We only began forming our team 3 months ago.
We have already lost many world champions, so it is extremely surprising that we were able to defend this Olympic championship.
To the UK team that has seized a total of 7 out of 10 gold medals in cycling at the Beijing Olympics and London Olympics, this is just another competition and another gold they won.
If this symbolized the improvement we have gained over the last five months, then in the next five days, we will continue to achieve success in the velodrome.
According to the performance provided by Kenny, there is a still chance for him to win 3 golds in a single Olympics just as Hoy did previously.
If this is the case, Kenny, 12 years younger than Hoy, and born on the same day on March 23 (this day appears to be a sacred day for British sports as Steven Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were all born of the same day), will have six gold medals and one silver medal.
This result equaled Hoy’s.
Next, Kenny will take part in the 3-day sprint event which starts today.
This 28-year-old from Bolton said, “I will focus on this match for now.”
Team competition is still the best.
You can win this competition together with your teammate.
To be honest, a one-man victory does seem a little lonely.
Hindes said, “If he can clinch the other two gold medals, he will be knighted.”
This is the only competition of the day where any medals could be won. However, the UK team received other good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke, and Owain Doull successfully entered, with the fastest speeds, the four-men 4-kilometer team pursuit.
Their score was 351.943.
For the 2012 London Olympics, the gold medalist established a world record of 351.659.
Today as the second game day will witness the first round and the final ( 10:42pm) . Wiggins will no doubt be the focus in the field.
He had an argument with a competition official during the qualifiers. The official had asked him to measure his height at that time.
Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell-Shand, Elinor Barker, and  Katie Archibald from Milngavie advanced in the women’s team event which will conclude tomorrow after setting a new world record of 413.260.
The British team leveraged the dominance of its strong track cycling team in the middle of the Olympics, and bagged numerous medals.
After the dominating wins during the Beijing and London Olympics, the performance of British bicycle team was a little bit disappointing in their journey toward the Rio Olympic.
A series of ups and downs occurred during this period, including the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton because of allegations of sexual discrimination and bullying, as well as the retirement of Hoy, Victoria Pendleton, and other legendary personalities.
However, the first evening of the competition at the bicycle stop demonstrated that the UK team will once again reach its legendary peak at the critical moment.
Future of Portland smelter uncertain with cancellation of power supply contract
The power company supply power to the plants disclosed that the owner of the plant will be terminating a supplier contract, an act that would lead to termination of all supplier contracts. The Portland Aluminum Smelter plant in Victoria and hundreds of workers currently face an uncertain future.
This measure was enacted after the government of Victoria decided to stop issuing subsidies that help keep the plants in business.
This 20-year fixed subsidy will end in November.
The 2,000 workers at the Portland plant of Alcoa Corporation may lose their jobs.
Once the factory shuts down, up to 2,000 people may find themselves directly or indirectly out of a job.
As total energy use of this plant makes up 10% of total power output of Victoria, it is unlikely that it would generate a chain reaction.
Alcoa Corporation shut down the Point Henry aluminum plant in 2014, which led to the shutdown of the Anglesey power station last year.
Alcoa’s Portland smelting plant is now loss-making and is at risk of closing down.
This measure was implemented after making predictions on the near future of the factory. The initial reason was the appreciation of the Australian Dollar. The recent reason is the price of the factory products.
AGL made use of the Latrobe Valley Loy Yang power plant to supply electrical power to this large aluminum smelting facility. This company also expects 3 owners of the factory to terminate the contract in the future.
The largest shareholder is a joint venture formed by Alcoa Corporation and Alox Company. CITIC Group from China and Marubeni Corporation from Japan also holds a small percentage of the shares.
The joint venture expressed: “AGL expects the Portland facility to continue operations. In other words, this smelting plant shall continue to demand electrical power.”
AGL said that these contracts were “hedging contracts” that should have become effective on November 2016.
The contract has a termination period of 12 months, and thus will be terminated in 2017.
The power company said, “As such, AGL still predicts these contracts to continue to produce revenue in fiscal year 2017.”
For the fiscal year of 2018, any impact to revenue that may be generated for AGL is currently affected by the optimistic prospects held by the futures market regarding the prices of wholesale electricity.
AGL expressed that the company has down-written a contract value of 187 million USD for “expected event of termination”.
Alcoa said that the decision to terminate the contracts ”does not affect Alcoa’s ability to operate the smelter or secure electricity supply to the smelter”.
This American company expressed that they have signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010. This contract was supposed to enter into force in November this year, but this company did not explain why it chose to withdraw.
Analysts remain circumspect with respect to the closure of the Portland Foundry at Victoria and Tomago plant in Newcastle as a result of the bad economy.
According to comments published earlier this week by analysts, AGL’s head of operations Stephen Mikkelsen expressed that annual power consumption of the Portland plant amounted to about 600 megawatt, while that of the Tomago plant was at about 900 megawatt.
If two factories close down, demand in the electricity market will fall significantly.
He expressed that: “As a power company, this is not good news to us.”
Community Legal Centres turn away 160,000 people each year
Every year, over 160,000 of the most underprivileged groups have been denied access to the community legal center. This service is already facing the issue of inadequate funds. Now they must face an additional budget slash.
In Queensland, three in every five persons have been rejected when seeking free legal advice and representation services. Most of these were the elderly, migrants, vulnerable workers, victims of abuse, as well as people without resources opposing unfair expulsion.
The lack of funding for community legal services has long been stretched beyond limit. Now the fund must face additional budget slashes.
From June next year, the federal government will reduce funds provided to these legal centers by another 30%.
James Farrell, Director of Community Legal Centres Queensland, said that according to a National Association of Community Legal Centres survey, thousands are turned away every year.
Mr. Farrell expressed that if the federal government does not change the current decision, this situation will only get worse.
He said, “Queensland’s Community Legal Centers constantly suffers from inadequate funding. This implies that many are unable to receive important services they require.”
People such as those who must seek shelter from violence, who are unable to pay back their large debts, families facing the threat of disintegration, and abused workers face legal issues. This report showed that they were unable to receive the help they need.
With effect from June 2017, the Federal government will cut funding by another 30%, implying that thousands of vulnerable groups in Queensland would be forced to face complex legal issues without any help.
We call upon George Brandis, Attorney-General and senator representing Queensland, to revoke the decision for cutting back investments so that people can acquire the help they need to deal with legal issues.
The state government made a commitment last year to increase the legal aid fund to the national average.
Priority must now be placed on community legal centres and how they correspond to the needs of the community. The Palaszczuk government must also commit to this important task.
Donald Trump’s election campaign official sued for gun threat
New York: The head of the Northern California Asia section of Trump’s presidential campaign staff was charged in February for driving a jeep and pulling a gun at another personnel as well as subsequent inaction
Former software instructor Vincent Bordini of the election team of the state described the incident at the State Court in Charlotte on Wednesday.
Bodini said that he had hoped that this would be resolved internally, but a few months later, he realized that it “was not going to happen”.
Descriptions by Bordini, the person in charge named Earl Phillip “pulled out a pistol and placed the index finger of his right hand on the trigger, and pointed the gun at Vincent’s knee cap.”
After complaining to the leaders of parties running for the local and district elections, Bordini learned from the letter of complaint that at least 4 other individuals have experienced the same.
Bordini expressed in the complaint: “No shots fired does not mean that no injury is caused.”
Two days before the case occurred, this Republican presidential nominee told the crowd at North Carolina that if his rival Hillary Clinton were to be elected and get to pick her favorite judge, then “the people who support the Second Amendment”, that is, people who own guns and gun lowers may take action. This statement led to public outrage.
Trump’s election team said that the media has taken his comments out of context. He did not advocate violence.
In the complaint, Bordini demanded the campaign staff to provide compensation for their lack of supervision, and also demanded Phillip to compensate his injuries caused by his attack, battery, and psychological attack.
Trump’s spokesperson Hope Hicks did not give an immediate response to this news.
Philip cannot be contacted.
WCCB, a local news company at Charlotte, reported that Phillipp has recently left the campaign staff.
His consultation company, Innovative Consulting Services, did not immediately respond to incoming calls.
Republican Party presidential candidate Donald Trump’s campaign staff has been hit by a series of controversies.
The case refers to Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Britain must channel the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow Airport
Heathrow will also bring vitality and prosperity to our community, to London and to the whole country.
To me personally, this is where the charms of Heathrow lies. During the 2012 London Olympics, we did our best to ensure that our country and local district are able to benefit from these competitions.
The Olympic Games benefited Stratford Upon Avon and the eastern regions significantly.
In addition, we can benefit this region again by creating opportunities for local residents and enterprises near Heathrow.
For just our local community, we will create 10,000 openings for apprentices and 40,000 new job opportunities, resolving the issue of unemployment for youths around the airport.
As was the case before the 2012 London Olympic Games, some people felt that the Heathrow expansion project was too big.
I've been told that the UK will not be able to prepare properly for the Olympics and that we will be shaming ourselves before the entire world.
The doubts held by skeptics regarding the 2012 Olympics were misplaced. Also, their doubts regarding the Heathrow project will ultimate prove to be false.
Although there are obstacles that must be overcome, Heathrow is addressing every problem that it faces.
Just like the Olympics, Heathrow is a infrastructure project initiated for the majority of the people, and not the minority.
The expansion project will create up to 180,000 new jobs, result in economic growth amounting to GBP211 billion, and provide a wealth of technology and employment opportunities to the areas around the airport and the entire UK.
We have an outstanding Heathrow project team. The has completed this infrastructure investment project worth 11.0 billion pounds within schedule and budget. The project include completion of the T5 terminal that was ranked as the world’s best airport terminal for five consecutive years, and the T2 terminal located between the two of the world’s busiest runways.
At this time, they are prepared to privately invest GBP16 billion to build the third runway.
The UK successfully hosted the 2012 London Olympics, and I believe that the project to expand the Heathrow Airport will achieve resounding success as well.
This is a good time for us to convey the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow Airport. This will allow us to safeguard our future and generate a wealth of technology and employment opportunities that the entirety of Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is the chairperson of Heathrow Airport and former Commercial Secretary to HM Treasury of the UK.
A woman committed suicide on a highway in Switzerland, and was run over and killed
The victims are lying on the highway during midnight.
This woman who attempted suicide was run over by multiple vehicles on the highway early Thursday morning. The police are looking for witnesses at this time.
The incident occurred in the early Thursday morning at Highway A1 near Morges at the canton of Vaud.
The police of Vaud canton expressed that a woman has, out of “despair”, laid on the highway and was crushed by multiple vehicles.
The victim was a 49-year-old Swiss woman. Her behavior was clearly suicidal. She was run over by multiple vehicles, including a truck.
The woman died on site.
The police expressed that multiple drivers involved in the incident have agreed to become part of the investigation progress, but a number of drivers has yet to confirm the request. The police encourages them and other witnesses of the accident to be part of the investigation.
Lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Tribune de Genève that criminal investigations have been initiated at this time, a standard procedure for such incidents.
However, he is currently unaware if there are drivers who facing accusations.
Can a collision be avoided?
Hofstetter said, “This will be determined by the prosecutor.”
For two similar incidents that have occurred in the last 5 years, the drivers were not held responsible for this.
According to this report, both cases were caused by people walking on the highway late at night. The final verdict is that the driver cannot predict that there would be pedestrians walking past the highway in midnight.
Last year, a police officer was accused of causing death by negligence. The charge was that in August 2014, she hit a man on the A1 expressway near Payerne resulting in his death.
The court learned that the 22-year old victim walked across the highway after consuming alcohol.
After an investigation, the judge said that the female police officer’s driving behavior was completely legal at the time, and that the appearance of the man on the road was a “totally unexpected and unforeseen circumstance”. What’s more, this female police officer called the emergency services after the incident occurred.
Anyone who can provide information on the incident which occurred near Morges on Thursday should contact the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus used to be hospitable to humans
According to the predictions made by the latest climate model of NASA, Venus was once suitable for human habitation.
Scientists at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center developed a model that could explore past conditions of Venus. The tools and algorithms used by this model are very similar to those used by climate scientists.
This model is used to verify whether Venus, with its high surface temperature, lack of water, and an atmosphere filled with carbon dioxide, ever had an earth-like environment.
In the past, scientists thought that the reason for the slower rotation rate of Venus was because it had a thicker atmosphere.
However, the latest simulation indicated that Venus may have had a thinner atmosphere similar to that of Earth, and its rotation speed at the time was similarly slower.
This model can even display the landforms of early Venus.
There may be more dry areas on Venus than on Earth, but it used to have enough water and geographic changes to nurture life as well as to prevent rapid evaporation.
Earlier, the sun was 30% brighter on the surface of Earth than on Venus.
Anthony Del Genio, a scientist in the Goddard Institute for Space Studies explained in a press conference: “In the model simulation used by Goddard Institute for Space Studies, the slow rotation of Venus meant that one side of the planet has a day length of as long as 2 months.”
This makes the surface warm and produces rain that can form thick clouds, which are like an umbrella that blocks most of the heat from the sun.
The results of the simulation show that the average climatic temperature of Venus was actually several degrees lower than that of modern-day Earth.
The evolution of Venus as simulated by this model was similar to earlier estimates made by planetary scientists.
Although life could have existed on Venus, the planet has been exposed to excessively high temperatures and ultra-violet rays over the course of billions of years.
The ocean on the planet evaporated, and the water vapor was also burnt away by UV radiation.
As hydrogen escapes, what remains are the thicker CO2 atmosphere and lethal greenhouse gas effect, forming what we now know as Venus.
Researchers published new results of Venus weather simulation models on the journal of Geophysical Research Letters
Patrick Roy resigned from his position as the captain of the Colorado Avalanche.
Patrick Roy resigned from his position as head coach and vice-president of the Colorado Avalanche, and expressed that he had no voice in decision making for the team.
Colorado’s Executive Vice President & General Manager Joe Sakic confirmed the news, and said that the club will immediately start looking for a new coach.
50-year old Roy expressed in a statement: “For the last 3 years, I have been actively, passionately, and doggedly live up to my duties as the head coach and vice president of the Colorado Avalanche.”
I have been thinking seriously all summer how to improve this team so that they can become stronger.
In this regard, the objective of the head coach and the Vice President must be consistent with that of the club.
He must be given a voice when making decisions that impact team performance.
However, these conditions have yet to be met.
Sakic hired Roy on May 23, 2013, and thanked Roy for the contribution he made to the team.
Sarquiss said, “Patrick informed me of his decision today.”
I thank them for his contributions for the club and wish him success in the future.
Roy was nominated as the League’s best coach in the Jack Adams Award in the first season after becoming the avalanche coach in 2013-2014.
He helped the club score 112 points, allowing them to secure the top rank in the central region. However, the Colorado team was defeated and ousted by the Minnesotans in the first round of the post-season games, and continued to miss post-season games in the two most recent years.
During the 2015-2016 season, the performance of the Avalanche include 39 victories, 39 draws, and 4 defeats. The team lost the second wild card qualification short of 5 points for the Western Hockey League.
As the goalkeeper of the hall of fame, Roy has won 4 Stanley Cups, winning two of them while playing for the Montreal Canadiens and another two while playing for Avalanche.
North Sea oil field workers end strike, negotiations continue
The chief negotiations representative expressed that the North Sea Oil workers have stopped strikes regarding employee pay. Both parties have initiated a new round of negotiations for this dispute.
The North Sea oil platform operated by the Royal Dutch Shell has experienced multiple strikes directed against the oil field service company Wood Group.
According to a joint statement, “Wood Group, Unite, and RMT unions can verify that we have agreed to restart the process to address the current dispute.”
We will start earlier from next week onward. In the next few weeks, multiple full-day conferences will be held. These issues will be re-examined.
The union expressed that actions taken recently is to protest salary reduction that may reach as high as 30%. This is the first time in 25 years that the union has taken such an act.
Wood Group lowered the compensation of North Sea contractors by about 9% this year because of market pressure.
Prior to this salary reduction, this company has reduced remuneration paid for overseas contractors by 10%.
The company said that another salary cut would help tide the company over the market downturn.
Shell has laid off thousands of workers and announced that it will be shutting down oil and gas facilities and plants in 10 countries. This is because Shell is required to streamline its businesses after its merger with British Gas.
Energy companies are facing pressure from declining crude oil prices and the Brexit decision in June.
David Anderson, a member of the Scottish Parliament, said earlier this week that he met with union leaders to investigate the biggest North Sea labor dispute in this generation.
He said that the North Sea is extremely crucial to the region’s economy.
In this statement, Dave expressed: “In the North Sea and for the entire country, we need an economy that serves the majority, and not the minority.”
In 2016, expenditure for new North Sea projects are not expected to exceed US$1.4  billion. In the last five years, the average project expenditure was approximately US$7 billion.
Kepler measured the rotation speed of a star in the Pleiades star cluster
The latest mission of the Kepler space telescope allowed astronomers to collect the most comprehensive information on the rotation speed of stars in the Pleiades.
New data are helping astronomers understand why the stars of this cluster have different rotation rates, and the correlation between rotation cycles and the formation of planets.
Luisa Rebull, a research scientist at the Infrared Processing and Analysis Center of California Institute of Technology at Pasadena, expressed in this press conference, “We hope to compare our results with other star clusters to gain further understanding of the mass and age of the stars, and even their relationship with the history of the solar system.”
The Pleiades star cluster is 445 light-years away from Earth.
Many of the stars in this star cluster were born about 125 million years ago. They have now just recently reached maturity.
They reached their maximum rotation speeds.
Upon reaching the maximum rotation speed, the mature star will emit large amounts of stellar winds.
When these stars pass through the magnetic fields of stars, they would produce a braking effect on the stars.
Stars will rotate at a slower pace as they age.
Kepler tracked identifiable star spots (such as sunspots) and the time of their appearance to calculate the rotating speed of reach star.
The latest data on rotation rates gathered indicated that stars with higher masses rotate at a slower rate than stars with lower masses.
Rebull compared the stars to dancers. Those with a larger physique pirouette at a slower rate compared to those who are more petite.
Rebull expressed: “In the ‘ballet’ of the Pleiades, we found that stars with a slower self-rotating speed tend to have larger mass, while stars with higher rotation speeds tend to be the lightest.”
As the Pleiades is quite close, it has thus become an ideal lab in space for comparing masses and self-rotation speeds of stars.
Raible indicated :" the Pleiades built a foundation for the bilateral rotation of young and old stellar.
As for how, when and why stars reduce their rotating speed and “keep away their dancing shoes”, there is still much that we need to learn.
Rebull and her colleagues gave a detailed elaboration of their latest analysis of the rotation rate of the Pleiades Cluster in three new theses. These theses will be published in the Astronomical Journal soon.
