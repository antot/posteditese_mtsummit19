Primary doctor strike: Calls for New Labour action
The junior doctor's representative called on the Coalition to approve New Labour actions for new contract disputes.
The British Medical Association's junior Physician Committee will require all its members to start supporting more labour operations since early September.
The junior doctors committee said the ministers had not resolved their concerns about the contract.
Junior doctors and medical students voted in July to boycott the contract deal with the British Medical Association.
58% of the members participating in the vote objected to the contract transaction.
McCourt, chairman of the junior doctors committee, said in a letter to members in late Thursday that the government had "always remained silent" on issues that led to a boycott of the contract.
"In view of this, the Executive committee of the Junior Medical Council has voted to reject the proposed new contract in its entirety and to call for a renewed formal consultation on all concerns," she said. ”
In response to the government's reticence, the executive committee of the junior doctors committee today formally requested the Council of the British Medical Association to convene a special session to approve a long-term plan for the commencement of the upgrading of labour operations from early September.
The dispute has led to the participation of junior doctors in six strikes this year, including the first comprehensive strike in the history of the British National Health-care system.
Dr. Johann Malawana, a junior physician leader at the British Medical Association, resigned after the British Medical Association's proposed contract agreement was rejected by a vote.
At a meeting of 54,000 junior doctors and medical students before the polls, he told members of the British Medical Association that the deal was good and should be accepted.
After the vote, the health minister, Jeremy Hunt, said the contract would be enforced among health care workers in England.
Russia and Turkey: "Incompatible alliances"?
A gesture to end a crisis.
Russian and Turkish leaders met in Tuesday, shaking hands and announcing a formal end to eight months of fighting and economic sanctions.
However, when Vladimir Putin greeted the Turkish president in a magnificent hall in the palace of St. Petersburg, I had a strong feeling that the settlement was what Ankara would most like to see.
Yes, the two sides did shake hands.
However, even as Mr Putin's usual standard of restraint, Putin is only a shallow smile, almost no enthusiasm.
According to reports, Recep five times mentioned "good friend" Putin.
I can't remember.
At the same time, he promised that relations with Russia would return to pre-crisis levels, even to a higher level.
The next day, a newspaper here wrote that Mr Erdogan acted as if nothing had happened.
But I think his enthusiasm hints at something opposite.
However, Mr Putin's persistent indifference suggests that he has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the first thing he mentioned in his opening remarks was the cause of the crisis: Turkey shot down a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border.
Moscow reacted violently.
Mr Putin lashed out at the incident, accusing Ankara of plotting against Moscow behind the scenes.
Attacks from so-called friends are more difficult to accept.
It is difficult, or impossible, to re-establish true trust.
Russian public opinion has also been reversed since November.
For months, the government-controlled media have made a shocking and all-out attack on Ankara.
Suddenly, the Turks seemed to be responsible for everything.
Among the most serious are accusations from senior officials: Mr Erdogan's family profited from the illegal oil deals in the so-called Islamic State-controlled Syrian region.
He has flatly denied such a statement.
However, the news from Fort Petersburg shows that it is time to look ahead.
After all, the meeting was premised on Mr. Putin's apology from Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Russia can declare victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of a truce are obvious.
First, Mr Erdogan narrowly missed his ouster after the coup failed last month, so he needs the support of all his friends.
The ongoing terrorist attacks have obviously hit him hard.
There are also economic motives.
Russia has been hit hard by sanctions against Turkey, in particular by banning charter services that can send millions of of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
The figure has fallen by nearly 90%.
As the flight resumes, Russian travel agencies and charter companies will be relieved.
They will usher in the Mediterranean tourist season at the quarter.
State television even predicted this week that the price of fruits and vegetables would fall once Turkey's agricultural imports were reopened.
A report in Vedemosti, a Moscow newspaper, said: "The tourists are gone and the tomatoes are back." ”
For Moscow, the visit also has added political value.
Ankara was outraged by the West's faint reaction to takeover intentions.
In addition, Ankara is keen to take advantage of the political chill and weaken Turkey's relations with the West in a long period of frustration over the slow progress of joining the EU negotiations and Mr Putin's involvement.
With the election of the elected authorities after the failure of the coup, Russia's leaders will be given Ankara's bonus points.
Note that this is a gift to Moscow, which has been deeply rooted in the fear of regime change.
Thus, the meeting in this magnificent seaside palace has made Russia and Turkey an ally of two countries rejected and abused by the West, an analyst who described it as "incompatible alliances".
However, despite public reconciliation, there are still significant differences between the two sides.
Syria is one of the key factors. Moscow recently played the role of a peacemaker in Syria, while Russia and Turkey supported the opposing factions.
Predictably, after nearly three hours of preliminary talks, the two presidents said at the press conference that they had not yet talked about the topic.
The Turkish president deliberately sidestepped the issue of disagreement between the two sides, while Putin stressed it.
The two sides have not reached a clear consensus on how to disagree on Syria.
The resumption of dialogue between the two leaders is certainly a good thing, with the possibility of months of open hostility and a major catastrophe caused by the shooting down of Russian warplanes by Turkey, a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer serve customers outside Scotland
According to RBS's chief executive, the bank will be reduced to a logistics unit.
Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer serve customers outside Scotland.
罗斯·麦克尤恩 told the BBC Scottish division that the Royal Bank of Scotland brand was committed to its global ambitions.
But eight years ago, the brink of collapse, had to accept the rescue from then on to abandon the pursuit.
During that time, brand strategists used ' RBS ' to protect other consumer financial brands.
The group has spent £ millions of to sponsor international sporting events, including the rugby six-nation tournament and Wimbledon tennis Championship champion Andy.
But now, the right thing to do is make more national brands emerge.
RBS will be used for Scottish customers but will not revert to the original.
In England and Wales, all references outside the headquarters and stock exchanges will be changed to the National Westminster Bank.
The Ulster Bank brand has been used to Ireland, Rep. Of customers in the Autonomous Region of Northern Ireland.
There are other, more prominent, smaller private banking brands, such as Guzi Bank, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt ' s military bank.
Mr. McEwen was interviewed by clients and employees in Inverness County.
He told the BBC's Scottish division: "The Royal Bank of Scotland brand will eventually become our investor brand and one of the employees ' hired brands because we have become a bank with many brands in the larger sense." ”
As the bank itself becomes an international brand, RBS has become a global brand.
At present, I would like to say that we are no longer focused on the global, we have turned our eyes to the mainland.
Each brand represents a different industry, and our employees serve their customers through different brands.
RBS has indicated it will not continue to sponsor the six-nation championships and has tried to raise the profile of different brands in sporting events.
"It's time to become a multi-brand bank, because in private we have been exploring how to become a better bank to serve our customers," the chief executive said. ”
It would be ironic if we aspire to be a big bank with many brands three years ago.
We are now focusing on customer needs and I believe you have noticed these changes.
I think we can restart these brands and the time is right.
Daituri with the success of predilection in Newmarket career 3,000 win
Newmarket's two victories helped Daituri get a career 3,000 victory, after which he sprayed champagne to celebrate
In Friday, professional jockey Daituri (Frankie Dettori) made his 3rd, 000 victory in Newmarket (Newmarket).
He took the Gollsden (John Gosden) 's hand predilection on the road, the two victories in the evening, also to achieve a career 3,000 win.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth professional jockey who has achieved this milestone in the field.
The first five were: Gordon Richard (Gordon Richards), Doug (Doug Smith), Berge (Lester Piggott), Weideley (Pat eddery) and Jason (Willie Carson).
"This is special," said Daituri, a three-year champion jockey who won the Ghayyar earlier. ”
I'm excited because my family is on the scene.
I am pleased with what I have achieved in Newmarket because I started here 30 years ago.
This is not a large-scale Jockey club, nor is it the Royal Ascot, which is just an ordinary Friday night with 20,000 spectators.
I am gratified and humble.
Daituri in the victory after the predilection, causing the audience cheers
In the area of the barrier, two jockeys have made this achievement, respectively the champion jockey 理查德·约翰逊 (Richard Johnson) and now retired 20 champion McCoy (Anthony McCoy) jazz, of which Sir McCoy has scored more than 4 in his record-breaking career, 300 victories.
Berge, a nine-year-German champion, won 4,493 victories in his career.
Daituri is one of the best jockeys in the contemporary era, so it is not surprising that he has achieved this milestone, not many people have achieved it before.
He is fashionable and robust, but what really makes him stand out in the weighing room is his tactical rationality.
He is a great equestrian ambassador, and over the years his enthusiasm and charisma have attracted a lot of fans for the sport.
A few weeks ago, I told Daituri in Epsom that if he wasn't just a weekend and a big-game jockey, he should have won 6,000 victories!
Seriously, Daituri is the best equestrian winner in 30 years in Britain.
He was lively, and that was a good thing for the British horse race, but beyond that he was an incredible jockey.
Daituri celebrates the milestone with its iconic jump-dismount action
For 20 years, Daituri has been a typical representative of the British Land race field, from jumping lines to jumping off the ground.
His career is like a roller coaster.
He won several championships, including the famous "Seven winning streak" in 1996 at the Royal Love Club, but he also suffered a crash and was banned for taking the banned drugs.
Three years ago, when he returned to the game after the end of the six-month cut-off period, he struggled. However, he showed an astonishing character advantage and finally returned to the top, giving blow to those who were skeptical.
He may not be able to do it for a long time-Daituri has said before that he wants to be at least 50 years old.
Russian President Vladimir Putin relieves Sergei Office director
Vladimir Putin, Russia's president, unexpectedly relieved Sergei (Sergei Ivanov) of the presidency of the Office of the Chief of staff.
Mr Ivanov has been a member of the core group that Mr Putin has trusted for years.
Mr Ivanov, now 63, has been appointed Special Representative on environment and transport.
A statement from the Kremlin said Mr. Putin had "announced the release of the Office of the Chief of the Russian president of Ivanov," but gave no reason.
安东·瓦伊诺 (Anton Vaino), who became deputy to Mr. Ivanov in 2012, has been appointed as his successor.
Mr. Vaino, 44 years old, is a former diplomat.
Born in 1972 in Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the embassy in Tokyo.
Later, he managed the presidential draft and government employees, the Kremlin's website (using Russian) said.
After his appointment, he said to Mr Putin: "Thank you for your trust." ”
I think the government's most important task is to support the heads of State in drafting laws and controlling the implementation of directives.
Mr. Putin told Russian television in Friday that Mr. Ivanov himself had asked to resign and recommended Mr. Vaino to take over.
Is such a smile convincing?
Moscow was puzzled by the move.
Sergei has long been one of Mr Putin's closest aides, working for the Soviet Security Service (KGB), as did Mr Putin.
As Director of the office, he was one of the most influential people in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin on state television, both men said the chief executive himself had asked to resign.
Although smiling in front of the camera, few people are convinced-especially before the parliamentary elections.
So, is this the result of a defeat in some sort of power struggle?
It is not yet known.
But the official claim that a man who was once seen as a candidate for the presidency suddenly chose to take charge of the environmental policy of Russia has aroused much scepticism.
The Kremlin website quotes Mr. Ivanov's dialogue with Mr Putin, saying: "Yes, at the beginning of 2012, I asked you to give me this difficult position in a conversation, even a troublesome position, a four-year term." "
"As a result, I have served as director of the president's Office for 4 years and eight months. "
Mr. Ivanov held the post in December 2011.
Prior to that, he served as Deputy Prime Minister and Secretary of Defense.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council, as well as former members of the National Security Service, like Mr Putin.
Mr. Ivanov was appointed as his deputy in the late 1990s when Mr. Putin served as director of the Federal Security Service (FSB, formerly the National Security Agency).
After Mr Putin came to power, he appointed Mr. Ivanov one of the five most trusted.
It was once thought that Mr Ivanov might be the president of Russia after Mr Putin's second term, since the third term is unconstitutional.
But the position is ultimately vested in Mr Putin's other close aide, Dmitry Dmitry.
Mr Putin served as Russia's prime minister before he was back in office after 3.5.
Mysterious fish discovered Banff a garden
A resident of Banff discovered that fish had found its own garden and had subsequently sent for help.
Kevin Bain thinks the 75 fish may be the sand eel that was blown by a tornado in the sea.
Mr. Bain, who lives about 500 metres from the Sea, released a video of the bizarre scene on Periscope, hoping someone could explain to him why these two-inch fish were present.
The Queensferry Bridge is now in Fife.
The £ 1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed in May 2017
Engineers have connected the North Bridge of the Queensferry Bridge (Queensferry Crossing) to the viaduct, which means that it is now in Fife.
The closure of the "bridge deck fan" near the three bridgehead of each bridge is nearing completion and the project is headed for a closed bridge.
The bridge starting in Fife is 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
It uses 10,000 metric tons of steel, 20,000 metric tons of concrete and 46 diagonal cables.
The £ 1.35 billion BN project is scheduled to be completed in May 2017.
Keith Brown, the economics minister, visited the scene today as one of the first people to board the bridge, 基思·布朗.
"This is a historic moment in the construction process of the Queensferry Bridge," he said. "
We have all witnessed the engineering work on such a grand project, which uses more than 30,000 metric tons of concrete and steel in this section of the bridge.
Although the bridge is large in size and weight, the closure between the viaduct and the bridge requires meticulous work and very precise assembly.
In general, nearly 79% of the total bridge deck is now installed, the last section of the bridge deck concrete bridge today in Rosyth pouring, that is, all the decks are ready.
Queensferry Bridge Construction Company project director Michael Martin said: "No matter which bridge project, the first closure is a major milestone." "
In terms of this remarkable project, the closure shows the frontier of civil engineering technology.
After installing the last section of the pavement and connecting it to the enlarged North Bridge pavement, the remainder of the remaining gap on either side or near the land will need to be closed.
The completion of this operation requires the North elevated approach to move south 700 mm.
It was a huge operation and a very sophisticated one.
It is large because the viaduct is 222 metres long and weighs about 6,000 tonnes and needs to pull out a slope of about 3%.
It is precise because the engineering team needs to make sure that the deviations are very small, with only a few millimeters on each side.
Thankfully, everything went well.
西蒙·拜尔斯 Picks Women gymnastics all-around champion
Forget about stress.
Forget about hype.
西蒙·拜尔斯 (Simone Biles) is not affected by all this.
The vault was full of vigor.
On the balance beam.
The floor exercises are stunning.
The overall performance is excellent.
Now, finally, became the Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast picked up all-around in Thursday and showcased her talent for the world in gymnastics in the Olympic arena.
She has a 62.198 overall score far beyond the silver medalist, the "Ultimate Five" (final Five) player Lesman (Aly Raisman) and bronze medalist Mustafina (Aliya Mustafina).
Simon Byers, from the United States, performed the balance beam on the women's personal all-around finals at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in Thursday.
Byers to help the United States team in the Olympic Games women's gymnastics to achieve four consecutive championships, she personally in the Olympic Games won five medals, further confirmed that she is this generation, also may be history, the best gymnasts.
When see oneself total score of that moment, Byers can't help shed tears. She finally ended the long journey.
Byers is thus among the "athletes of the past decades", like Michael Phelps, who have promoted their sports to new heights:
Byers has been dominating the tournament for the last three years, winning 15 world championships, including 10 gold medals. She trained hard every day to achieve higher accuracy. "Byers is the best gymnast I've ever seen," said Mary Lou Retton, 1984 Olympic champion 玛莉·卢·雷顿. ”
There is still one last game in Brazil, but it is not so much a contest as Byers and other gymnasts, but a contest between herself and the pressure of great expectations.
If Byers does not have a full gold medal back at her home in Texas Springs, everyone will be very disappointed.
西蒙·拜尔斯 (left) and Lesman, from the United States, embraced each other in August (Thursday) at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, for the women's individual all-around finals with gold and silver medals respectively.
Byers won the first gold medal in Tuesday, giving the retiring national coach Caroli (Martha Karolyi) a surprise farewell gift.
Although Bairstine says he has no plans for the future in the course of the perennial title, it is not entirely true.
The part of Byers's floor exercise--including her iconic, Rolling series, was accompanied by Latin music, which she heard in the middle of a street from the Rio Olympic Stadium.
This is no coincidence.
The girl who was adopted by his grandparents during his infancy and was found by the mother of Coach 艾米·伯尔曼 (Aimee Boorman) during a field trip to the stadium has now grown into a backbone.
Since the summer of 2013, Byers has not lost in the all-around game, if want to win, she will definitely win.
Mustafina a slight lead after two rotations is just an illusion.
The balance beam and floor exercise two-item defending world champion Byers ambush to wait.
Her balance beam scored 15.433 and the floor was 15.933.
While waiting for the final score to come out, Lesman gently hugged Byers. When Byers learned of his dream to achieve the results, immediately left tears.
Lesman's performance was a bit like revenge for four years ago, when she tied third, but lost to Mustafina in the winning innings.
But this time, the 22-year-old captain, nicknamed "Granny" by the Americans, is far ahead.
She blew kisses at the end of the floor and declared her return, but the return sometimes seemed questionable.
Byers is only 19 years old. From earlier this week, the news spread viral on Twitter. In the case of Byron, his life has been endowed with new meaning.
6-year-old Mahaj Brown was spared in the Philadelphia shootings.
Police say a six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, a six-year-old child in the city's second shot this week.
The child's grandparents confirmed to CBS Philadelphia that the child being shot was Mahaj Brown.
Brown's groin, legs, arms and abdomen have multiple gunshot wounds, they say, but the child is awake on the way to the hospital.
"He's had a lot of sins and his little body was riddled with bullets," his grandmother Delores Melendez told the television.
I can't believe it.
The boy was in a critical condition at the hospital and had been undergoing several surgeries.
His family told the TV station that children are expected to recover.
He was supposed to start his first grade in a local primary school.
Brown is one of four people who were shot in the Germantown area.
Of the other three people who were shot, two were 29 years old and one 32 years old.
According to CBS Philadelphia, one of the 29-year-old victims was in critical condition and two other victims were in stable condition.
Television said the child and the 29-year-old victim was found in the front seat of the car.
The other two were not in the car and the police were investigating whether the gunman was among the injured.
Investigators told CBS Philadelphia that it looked like multiple gunmen had exchanged fire.
Many of the shells of offensive weapons were found at the scene, which could be inferred that they were using different offensive weapons.
Judging from this, this is undoubtedly a continuous war.
There are shells on the sidewalks on both sides of the street.
"Therefore, it can be seen that at that time there were many armed men in a state of fierce fighting," Philadelphia Police Commissioner Anthony Ginaldi told television.
A number of buildings and vehicles have been damaged in the area.
No arrests have been made, and police are said to be watching surveillance footage.
In Tuesday, a six-year-old child (girl) was shot in the arm by a stray bullet while playing at the doorstep of the Oak Lane community in West.
She is recovering and the police are still chasing suspects.
Why do we need Simon, Gabrielle and Laurie?
That's why I'm judging this year's women's Olympic gymnastics team for more than one reason.
First of all, since 1984, I have been to every Summer Olympics, but the United States has never been such a dominant position.
Second, the gymnastics team has three excellent gymnasts-西蒙·拜尔斯 (Simone Biles), 加布丽埃勒·道格拉斯 (Gabby Douglas) and 劳瑞·埃尔南德斯 (Lauren Laurie Hernandez), They have been inspiring many colored girls.
The composition of this team has made everyone proud, as it contains the Jewish 阿里·莱斯曼 (Aly Raisman) and the Catholic Madison Chian (Madison Kocian).
The team finally looks like the American team.
It also cemented the pinnacle of black and Hispanic women in the sport.
The leading female gymnasts have been African-American for the past four years.
Last year, Simon and Gabrielle the first and second place.
That's too bad.
The last Olympic Games, 加布丽埃勒·道格拉斯 "unexpectedly" became the Olympic champion, which cheered the United States.
Today, the world can witness three world champion 西蒙·拜尔斯, Douglas and 劳瑞·埃尔南德斯 fantastic performance. They performed the usual gymnastics skills.
In Thursday, Simon helped the United States to achieve four consecutive championships in women's individual all-around projects.
Her teammate 阿里·莱斯曼 the silver medal.
We climbed to the top of the sport, but not in the American gymnastics class.
The way Simon, Gabrielle and Laurie entered the Olympic team was the same as Ali and Madison.
They are the "Ultimate Five" (final Five), because the next Olympic gymnastics team will be composed of four gymnasts, this is Marta Karolyi last year to teach.
But the reality is, gymnastics is an expensive sport in which gymnasts are trained mainly in private gymnastics clubs, and their parents need to pay for training, facilities, travel, clothing, competitions and hotel fees (including the costs of coaches and gymnasts and their families), and the list of costs is increasing.
Most of the gymnastics clubs are located in affluent suburbs that can support the industry.
All of the gymnasts ' training is done at these clubs and is a long and expensive expense for gymnasts ' families.
Byers's coach 艾米·伯尔曼 (Aimee Boorman) and Hernandez's coach Maggie Haney have been coaching them since the two gymnasts began practicing gymnastics.
We must bring more affordable, more accessible gymnastics training to countless young girls affected by Simon, Gabrielle and Laura.
20 years ago, I set up my own gymnastics foundation.
In my organization, we offer free, inexpensive gymnastics to more than 15,000 urban youths (mostly black and Hispanic Americans) in black neighborhoods, and to develop national and even world champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high-quality gymnastics to those who deserve this learning opportunity and who will benefit from this remarkable Olympic campaign.
Gymnastics can help to cultivate the strength, flexibility and coordination of the body, but also help to cultivate hard-working spirit, self-discipline and determination.
These can lead to lifelong benefits for a person's health, education, and success in work.
Inspired by this team, thousands of young girls will learn gymnastics, which is really great.
Participation in sports is significant, especially for girls.
It was an exciting moment.
Thanks to Simon, Ali, Laurie, Gabrielle and Madison for the "Girl power" that has been shown in winning the Olympic team gold medals, and for inspiring young girls with so many backgrounds to open the path to health, greatness and success.
After dismissing the Jeremy proposal, the junior doctors plan to initiate a further strike
The ministers initially wanted to end the change-induced dispute by accepting a revised contract from the British Medical Association (BMA) officials, but 58% of the 37,000 junior doctors who voted were against the contract.
In July, Mr. Hunter revealed plans to enforce the contract, saying that the NHS is currently in a "vacuum zone" and that a slight delay would hurt the interests of employees and patients.
The new contract first mentions changes in the working practices of primary doctors overnight and weekend to improve the care of irregular working hours.
In a statement last night, Dr. Ellen McCourt, chairman of the BMA Junior Physician Committee, said: "There is still serious concern among junior physicians about the proposed contract, especially in the interest that it will exacerbate the current labour crisis and not treat all doctors fairly." ”
It's only eight weeks before the first doctor signs the new contract and we need to make progress.
BMA tried to resolve the dispute through negotiations, but everyone was unwilling to participate, and sometimes the government responded with silence.
Still, last month, we got Jeremy's promise, saying that his door was always open.
"Jeremy now needs to take action to eliminate enforcement and address the concerns of junior doctors."
If he does not, the junior doctors make it clear that they are ready to take further labor action.
The last strike, which occurred at the end of April, resulted in nearly 13,000 routine surgeries and 100,000 appointment delays, as nurses and consultants covered the picket line for doctors.
The ministers initially hoped to end the dispute caused by the change by accepting BMA's revised contract.
BMA hopes to secure better weekend pay for the 54,000 junior doctors involved in the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, chief executive of NHS Employers, called on junior doctors to stop any further strikes.
Mr Mortimer said: "The effect of the labour action is minimal, but it will put pressure on the teams and services already devoted to them, causing worries, worries and confusion among patients, nursing staff and their families." ”
Over the past two months, we have been negotiating with the junior doctors ' committee, and have been actively responding to their concerns about the role of guardians and the disclosure of their complaints with the Ministry of Health and other departments.
Employers want to continue to actively explore other important topics, such as deployment, the flexibility of training, the cost of other training, training, common recognition of curriculum outlines, continuing education leave and gender wage differentials in the medical field are illustrated by employers, the Health education organization of England (Health Education England and the Ministry of Health attached great importance to the agreements reached with BMA in November, February and May.
2 pounds of drugs a day can reduce the risk of heart attack.
Officials suggest that a drug of 2 pounds a day be extended to more patients and to take longer, and thousands of heart patients will benefit from the drug.
Anticoagulant drug Ticagrelor (ticagrelor) can reduce the risk of heart disease recurrence in patients with heart disease.
The drug, which lasts for 12 months after a heart attack, can reduce the risk of another stroke or heart attack.
The National Institute of Health and Clinical optimization (NICE), a regulator of the NHS, advises patients to continue taking four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.
But now, the NHS regulator, Nice, recommends that patients continue to take four years of medication to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.
In England, about 140,000 people suffer from heart disease each year, and One-fourth continue to suffer from heart attacks or strokes.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by the accumulation of fatty matter in the arterial wall.
If the plaque is broken, it can lead to thrombosis, which in turn hinders blood flow to the heart, leading to heart attack.
If the thrombus moves, it enters the bloodstream, hindering blood flow to the brain and causing a stroke.
Patients who have experienced a heart attack have a higher risk of heart attack.
Ticagrelor is made by the British company AstraZeneca (AstraZeneca), which is marketed in the name of Linda (Brilique), which reduces the risk of developing the disease by reducing thrombosis.
The nice draft guidelines, released today, recommend that patients take the ticagrelor for 12 months, taking 60mg Ticagrelor and two aspirin a day for three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the Nice Health Technology Assessment Center, said: "Despite effective two-level preventive treatment, up to one-fourth patients with a history of heart attack relapse or stroke, often with serious consequences." ”
Fear of recurrence can have a great negative impact on a person's quality of life.
Evidence suggests that taking ticagrelor with aspirin can effectively reduce the risk of heart disease recurrence and stroke in patients who experience a heart attack.
We are pleased that the temporary recommendation for Ticagrelor will provide more treatment options for thousands of people who benefit.
Given the limited information about the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor in three years, especially the risk of bleeding, the draft guidance does not recommend continuing treatment after that period.
Computer culture makes "electoral fraud" prevalent in Muslim areas
Tower Hamlets, former mayor of Lutfur Rahman, was sacked last year for corruption, prompting a government report.
The culture of "political correctness" has led to the blindness of electoral fraud prevalent in Muslim communities, as the government's report, which is destructive, is revealed today.
Sir 埃里克·皮克尔斯, the former cabinet secretary, has accused the police, the election regulator and the city hall of ignoring the evidence of the misuse of the election because of "overly sensitive to ethnicity and religious issues".
The former Minister of Community Affairs, the current anti-corruption chief, said the practice of intimidation of voters by religious positions was bad and that police should be allowed to set up a cordon outside polling stations to protect frightened voters.
He advises voters to carry identity documents to prove their identity.
At present, voters only need to quote their name and address.
The report even suggests wiping out ink on voters ' fingers to prevent people from voting two times.
Sir Eric said the protection of whistleblowers should be stepped up.
He called for an increase in the media's access to parliamentary documents and decisions made by non-official committees or working groups.
"It's not just to prevent electoral fraud, but to protect local governments from widespread corrupt culture and the toxic financial scams that are closely linked to them," he said.
The report was requested by Downing Street after the Tower hamlets election scandal in Eastlondon.
Last year, a special election court ruled that there was a series of corruption and illegal acts in the mayor's office, and should be dismissed.
The court found that Mr. Rahman was "very ridiculously abusing" the religious sentiments of the Muslim community and kept silent about his accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
It is said that Rahman "declared his vote in the campaign as a religious obligation of loyal Muslims." ”
As many as 300 ballot papers are doubtful, voters may be counterfeited by others to vote.
Sir Eric says there is evidence that electoral fraud has been found all over the country.
In particular, he warned of the mailing of electoral fraud, where senior members of the Muslim community were said to have pressured voters to vote for their designated candidates.
Sir Eric (in the photo) has given a number of suggestions for clearing the voting mechanism, including the identification of identity documents to prove his identity.
"The evidence indicates that senior members, particularly in Pakistan and Bangladesh, have put pressure on the disadvantaged groups of minority communities, especially women and young people, to vote on their own volition," he said in his report. ”
"Because they are overly sensitive to racial divisions and religious ' political correctness ', they fear that state institutions will turn a blind eye to such behaviour." ”
Sir Eric proposed 50 proposals to clean up the voting system, including banning political activists from sending ballot papers to prevent "voting gains".
The report also requires strict checks on registration information to prevent voter rosters from being used for immigration and welfare fraud. Theresa (Theresa May) is also considering the report.
These proposals include requiring electors to show their identity cards before voting.
After the vote, the voter's fingers were smeared with indelible ink to prevent a two-time vote.
Systematic verification of voters ' ethnic affiliation to ensure voter eligibility.
Limit the validity of the automatic Mail poll request to three years.
Political activists and activists are barred from handling completed mailings and mailing ballot envelopes.
Authorized police to set up a cordon around the polling station.
The amendment of the legal provisions makes it easier to charge the persons concerned with intimidation in accordance with the 1983 People's Representative act (Representation of the People Act 1983).
It is illegal to take pictures at a polling station.
It is stipulated that only English (except Wales) can be used at polling stations.
(a) Strengthen training to ensure that staff members strictly implement the provisions of the "voter-independent vote-room".
Sir Eric denounced the Metropolitan Police (metropolitan Police), saying they were "surprised" that no criminal charges had been filed after the Tower hamlets incident.
"There are a lot of corruption and irregularities in Mr. Rahman and his election officers, and are therefore disqualified from the electoral court," he said.
He was guilty in many ways, in accordance with the standards of criminal proof.
He also criticized the City Hall election registration department as "check box".
"Last year the court sounded a wake-up call on Tower Hamlets's verdict," said Sir Eric. ”
Our country has a glorious tradition of "the Mother of parliament", but it is a matter of concern and threat to the good reputation of some institutions in the private and furtive conduct of electoral fraud and subsequent repudiation.
The contestants who look like Kate Middleton's cyclists and other celebrities in the Rio Olympics have been courted.
The French cyclist 波林·费朗德·普雷沃 (Pauline Ferrand Prevot), who looks like Kate Middleton in the 2016 Rio Olympics this week, was eagerly sought after by viewers.
But the 24-year-old is not the only gold medalist in this summer's Olympics, at least not by social media.
So, to commemorate the Rio Olympics and all the celebrity faces appearing on the screen at that time, FEMAIL sorted out a list of the Olympians who had bumped into Hollywood stars.
Hunter and Wolf: American male archery player 布莱迪·埃里森 (Brady Ellison) (left) from childhood to Leonardo DiCaprio (Leonardo DiCaprio)
In addition to the contestants who hit Kate on the bike track, many netizens quickly discovered that an archer was a twin brother of Leonardo DiCaprio.
The American male archery 布莱迪·埃里森 has caused a great stir in social media since his photograph of the Wall, the Wolf of the Wall Street, has been exposed to Twitter.
In fact, the Archer sensed the hype of social media and admitted that small people said they looked like little plums.
"I don't think it looks like anything other than a beard," Brady told the Huffington Post (Huffington Post).
"He's a good-looking playboy, so I guess it's a compliment." ”
One of the most popular contrasts in the 2012 London Olympics will no doubt be found in more similarities this year: The British long jumper 格雷格·卢瑟福 (Greg Rutherford) looks like a famous actor Harris (Neil Patrick Harris).
Mustafina (Aliya Mustafina), a Russian gymnast with big, talking eyes, was said to resemble Cuban-American singer 格洛丽亚·埃斯特凡 (Gloria Estefan).
In swimming, for years, South African swimmer 卡梅伦·范德伯格 (Cameron van der Burgh) has been compared to "Glee" (Glee) starring Matthew Morrison (Matthew Morrison).
Dress up: The user thinks Yi Jia Jun (Nathan Adrian) is the "sports version" of the "Inception" (Inception) actor.
Another pair of old men were compared to tennis star Nadal (Rafael Nadal) and actor Hartnett (Josh Hartnett), whose eyebrows and lips looked alike.
Russian swimmer Effimo (Yulia Efimova) and actor 安娜丽尼·麦考德 (AnnaLynne McCord) have the same bronze skin and blonde hair, while the American team's Yi Jia Jun is likened to "the sporty version of 约瑟夫·高登·莱维特" (Joseph Gorgon Levitt) ".
Female man: Soccer star 霍普·索罗 (Hope Solo) (left) and "bloodthirsty forensic" (Dexter) actor 珍妮弗·卡彭特 (Jennifer Carpenter) (right) with similar face shape and eyes
Not the only one: a Twitter user is happy to find that other people have seen these similarities
Communication theory: According to the user, this pair looks like maybe there's a reason.
One Twitter user recently happily claimed online that "other netizens also think 霍普·索罗 and 珍妮弗·卡彭特 actually look exactly the same." ”
Indeed, the American football star and the bloodthirsty M.E. have a very similar face and eyes.
Other popular comparisons include 克丽·沃尔什·詹宁斯 (Kerri Walsh· Jennings), her smile almost the same as the actress Laura Catherine (Laura Linney), and the gold-medal gymnast 盖比·道格拉斯 (Gabby Douglas), her beautiful and brilliant smile and "glamour" (Bring It on Star) Star Gabrielle (Gabrielle Union) smiles the same.
CBC Olympic commentator apologizes for Chinese swimmer's "slow like a pig" comment
Wednesday, 拜伦·麦克唐纳 (Byron MacDonald) to the 14-year-old teenager Ai Ying with the fourth place of the female 4x200 rice freestyle relay race angered by watching the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) Olympic live broadcast audience
An announcer at the Canadian Broadcasting company CBC said the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer was forced to apologize after the "start of a race that was faster than the stench" and ended "as slow as a pig".
Narrator 拜伦·麦克唐纳 at the end of the women's 4x200 freestyle relay finals when he thought his microphone had been turned off.
"The 14-year-old Chinese girl made a stupid mistake," said Byron, who was told by the CBC commentator team, who wore the "tinted glasses" commentary. ”
Being so excited, I began to travel faster than the stench, but later I was as slow as a pig.
Thanks to her.
The 14-year-old Chinese swimmer, Ai Ying, has a second-best tour, with 1 minutes and 57 seconds 79--泰勒·拉克 (Taylor ruck) 1.61 seconds behind Canada, which narrows the gap with China.
The entire Canadian audience was surprised by the narrator's tone and wording, and they quickly reacted on the internet.
Emmett Macfarlane, the CBC commentator, said that China's 14-year-old swimmer was ' slow as a pig '??? ”
The idiot didn't realize it was on the live.
"The 14-year-old Chinese girl made a stupid mistake," the Chinese teenager Ai Ying, who participated in the final of the women's 4x200 freestyle relay race, included this description. ”
Twitter's criticisms of 拜伦·麦克唐纳 have been sweeping over Twitter, and many have asked them to withdraw from the commentary.
When Twitter users heard that 拜伦·麦克唐纳 was unresponsive, they didn't stop there.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote, "Wow, 拜伦·麦克唐纳."
You represent CBC and Canada, and your words and deeds make us all sound like a bunch of racist people. #真令人讨厌.
Soon after, CBC radio host Scott Russell apologized for his comments in the broadcast, saying: "We apologize for the commentary on the performance of the live swimmer." ”
"We are sorry for the untimely wording." ”
CBC apologizes to Twitter users who responded to the comments more than 90 times
Another commentator, Scott Russell, also apologized to Byron.
CBC then copied their apology to the other 90 Twitter users who protested the Byron commentary.
The channel also quickly apologized and issued a statement.
We are very sorry to say this and live out the broadcast.
Last night, we took swift action to apologize to viewers who watched our live audience and to our audience in social media.
It should be explained that Byron's explanation is for swimmers, but not for her personally.
That is to say, the wording is indeed inappropriate, and Byron is deeply sorry.
In the afternoon of Thursday, MacDonald apologized on the live, saying that his words did not mean any personal attack, and tried to justify his remarks.
"I'd like to take some time to apologize for what I said last night in the end of the women's relay race," he says on the CBC Olympic relay.
"I'm just commenting on swimmers ' performance, not personal." ”
"Of course, I have no disrespect for the meaning, I am sorry. ”
Primark customer expressed anger at a woman who brazenly tried to wear underwear in the center of the shop
A woman in a Primark shop in the central spot strip test underwear, the shop customers do not know where to look.
To make things worse, she looked at how she looked when she put it on, then took her panties off and put it back on the shelf.
She went on to browse the shelves and eventually tried on four underpants in the store at the Bouverie Place Mall in Folkestone.
The woman tried to wear underwear in the Primark store at the Bouverie Place Mall in Folkestone and put it back on the shelves.
Jenny Davidson (two children's mother), who was also in the store, said that after trying on her underwear, the mysterious woman "dressed again and went out of the store and bought nothing." ”
"No one can believe what they have seen," she said. ”
She was standing in the middle of the store, taking a pair of panties off the shelves, stripping off her tights and panties, and then putting them on.
"She didn't try to find a hidden place to try on--she just stood there, really cheeky. ”
When she took off her panties again, everyone was stunned. Apparently, she was still dissatisfied because she put her panties back on the shelves. ”
After that, she tried three like this, and finally found out that she didn't like it, then dressed again and went out of the shop.
"She doesn't seem to care that someone is looking at her--or that she's not going to end up buying the panties she's trying to get through," she said. ”
Ms. Davidson, who lives in Kent town (33 years old), said: "It's disgusting to think that someone will buy underwear that other people have walked through and have not been washed." ”
It happened in the afternoon of Tuesday.
Ms. Davidson added: "After she left, it was obvious that the clerk had to deal with the underwear." ”
"I hate to buy a new pair of underwear and find another woman trying to cross it and not being washed." ”
"Primark already knows what happened in our Folkestone shop August 9 (Tuesday)," said a spokesman for Primark. ”
All the problematic goods have been under the shelves.
How to protect yourself with the use of gamma in a gun attack
The world is dangerous, but this video on DailyMail. com may give you a sense of security.
We consulted the master Rhon Mizrachi of New York's Krav Maga Federation to learn how to deal with gunmen at close range.
Whether he is close to you from the front or behind, the video will teach you how to defeat.
Mizrachi said that if the shooter approached you from behind, the first thing you had to do was turn around so that you could see the attacker and "clear the line".
Then, hold the gun with your forearm and shoulder and hit the attacker on the face with your elbow.
Then with the knee on his groin, when the attacker bent over with pain, he reversed his gun, hit him in the face with the barrel and the backing gun, and kept the weapon on him.
If the gunman comes in from the front, it also uses a similar technique--to keep your body out of the firing line, grab the gun and twist the muzzle so that the shooter doesn't fire.
At the same time, press the weight on the gun and hit the attacker on the chest and twist the muzzle from his clenched hand and then point the muzzle at him.
Sounds complicated?
Check out the video to see what Mizrachi is doing.
But remember, if you're not the master of the Gamma, the safest way to get out of a robbery is to hand over the cash.
A family of rogue families destroyed a low-rent house in Sortas, Cornwall, before being deported.
A family of rogue families who had been evicted for threatening their neighbours had damaged their low-rent housing before leaving, costing 50000 of pounds.
After a long list of complaints, Tanya Skeldon and her husband, Shaun Trebilcock, were evicted from a low-rent house in the Cornish County of Sortas.
After being forcibly removed from the residence, housing association officials were surprised to find that there had been serious damage.
The walls were full of holes, the floors torn, the rubbish strewn all over the floor, the walls smeared with clutter.
After being expelled, the family has been moving and is said to be living in a private house.
Donna McEvoy, housing manager at Cornwall County Housing Association, said she feared the house could not be saved.
"It's a nightmare for people who live here, and I don't think people can live like this," she said. ”
There are a lot of things to weigh now, because this House is likely to become a bad element in Cornwall.
The family is notorious and their names are equally notorious.
The couple had three sons and they would live here from time out. Police said the family's terrorist acts include the use of baseball bats in the streets to fight, intimidation of nearby residents, drugs, drug trafficking, shouting, quarrels and swearing.
In June, the 47-year-old tenant named Skeldon received a resolution on anti-social behavior.
In a house that could be demolished, many of the rooms are long rubbish.
In this room where the drugs were traded, the floors were lifted.
Neighbors say they often see them fighting in the streets, and they often call the police
After giving them a 11-week extension, the Cornish Housing Society forced her and her husband to drive away from the house this week.
The neighbors, who finally breathed a sigh of joy, said that life had been a living hell.
"They don't care about anyone," said one neighbour. ”
We've lived next door to them for 20 years, and it's been so bad.
We've seen the police countless times.
"We couldn't sleep this morning." ”
We got up early because it was so quiet-we weren't used to it!
It's very kind of them to leave at last.
Fitzpatrick, the Community executive manager of the Cornish Housing Society, said the family had failed to cooperate with the local government.
The family lived in the house for 20 years and the police often visited
Rubbish and old toys were tossed over the overgrown side of the low-rent rent
He added: "It is regrettable that the tenant has not been held responsible for the conduct of her family and the expulsion is the last thing considered by the Cornwall Housing Association." ”
This is a very difficult case to deal with, because their behavior is very extreme, and what they do must make the neighbors feel extremely terrified.
I am thankful for the work done by my team and thanks to the Devon and Cornwall Police as well as the community members who are brave enough to provide us with information.
I hope this will bring some comfort to our neighbors and convey the message that we are not tolerant of anti-social behaviour.
Mr Fitzpatrick says three of their sons lived in the house at different times, but said they were only more than 20 years old.
After they were driven away, one of the bedroom floors was littered with a dirty mattress.
Housing association workers will soon be cleaning up piles of rubbish around the house
In 2014, police raided the house, found more than 70 grams of cannabis, and found scales, drug paraphernalia and 1,700 pounds of cash.
After pleading guilty, Skeldon was fined for possessing class B drugs and drug trafficking.
She claims that the money was used to buy gravestones for the son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
It is understood that after homeless, Tanya and her husband now live in a private house in Plymouth.
The walls of the house were painted with graffiti.
Police said they would expel tenants who defied tenant rules.
Angela Crow, of Devon and the Cornish Police Department, said the eviction sent a clear warning to other tenants who continued to defy tenant rules.
"The warning is for people who think their actions are not being blamed, and those who have been devastated by this behavior," she said.
Devon and Cornwall Police will never tolerate crime and anti-social behaviour, and they'll continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Reid: Hillarijo elected president will nominate Garland to the Supreme Court
Harry Reid, the Senate Democratic leader, said he was convinced that if Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate, was elected president, she would nominate Garland (Merrick Garland) to the Supreme Court.
Senate Republicans have blocked confirmation of Garland since President Barack Obama nominated Garland in March.
Senate Majority Leader McConnell Mitch McConnell said the next president will choose this person to replace the late Supreme Court Judge Scalia (Antonin Scalia).
Reid said in a conference call in Thursday that he predicted Hillary would choose "some credibility" garland.
A spokeswoman for Reed said later that Reed did not talk directly to Hillary about whether he would nominate Garland and said he was just guessing.
He praised Rand and said Hillary's team did not want to "disrupt" the new candidate.
Garland is the chief judge of the United States Columbia, Dist. OF Federal Circuit appeals court.
Mr. Reid said the Republicans who blocked the nomination of Garland were the "doting" and "achievers" of the Republican presidential candidate, Donald Trump.
He said that Trump was not fit to be president.
"Treats": Nude Calendar "men and women alike"
Treats magazine will join hands with photographer David Bellemere in a 2017-year calendar of inspiration from the the 1970s Pirelli.
This time, they plan to find a new generation of top models for their 2017 NU muses calendar, rather than a famous nude person.
Steve Shaw, president of treats, said earlier this year that their nude magazines differed from the old-fashioned playboy, because "the latter is for men." ”
And we face women.
Obviously, he thinks this group of calendars is the same.
"We need to show the timeless, classic nudity that makes both women and men feel comfortable, and this is the inspiration," Shaw told a calendar presentation.
Women will be happy to participate in this shoot because it is a beautiful artwork.
Models can submit photos online and apply for public recruitment to Los Angeles and New York in person.
The video report shows that the sleeping shark is the longest-lived vertebrate.
The Greenland shark is the longest-lived vertebrate on earth, scientists say.
Julius Nielsen, who has been studying sharks, says the age of a female head sleeper is estimated to be between 272 and 512 years, up to five metres.
French court rejects petition to dismantle shops in jungle camps
A French court has dismissed a petition by the Government of Calais to dismantle dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in the jungle camp. Thousands of refugees currently reside in the camp.
At the court hearings this week, the government argued that the French government should have the right to dismantle a total of 72 makeshift shops in the camp. People in these stores in the camps sell goods ranging from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts, and sell tea at 50 cents (40 pence) in makeshift restaurants or selling basic meals at a few euros.
The Office of the District of Calais believes these places should be dismantled because they are parallel economies that do not pay taxes, as well as fire and health hazards.
Humanitarian groups have indicated to the court that these shops and restaurants are of paramount importance, as the free food provided by state-backed associations and other groups simply cannot meet the needs of the growing refugee population in the camp.
These makeshift shops and restaurants often provide shelters and free food for those in need, they say.
A court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis to expel the operators of the 72 temporary shops, but said the concerns of the governor of Calais were "fully understandable".
Jean· Judge François Molla says the role of these grocery stores, cafes and restaurants is much more than simply providing food to refugees who "live in extremely dangerous conditions".
These places, he says, are a calming point of convergence between refugees and volunteers.
One of the threats to demolition was the "Jungle Book Kids" Café in the camp, which offered 200 servings of food, English and French lessons each day, as well as advice on asylum for hundreds of of the less-than-vulnerable minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed petitions to protect the café.
The closure of the café "will be a catastrophe for these children (many children are only eight years old)," wrote a letter to the Guardian (Guardian). ”
Help refugees and L ' Auberge des migrants, two charitable organizations, estimated in Friday that the number of refugees in the jungle camps had exceeded 9000, the highest level since the summer refugee population surged.
The British won the silver medal in the seven-man rugby game and Fiji won the gold medal.
In the final of the seven-man rugby game in the evening of Thursday, the British team was defeated by Fiji in 43:7 at the Riotio Doro Stadium after failing to perform well before Fiji.
Fiji won the gold medal for its impeccable performance in possession, interception, avoidance, co-ordination, running and strength, the first Olympic medal in the country's history.
The silver medal was a great consolation to the defeated British team, which was the third silver medal The British delegation had won that day. The score was enough to make the English Olive team proud: They beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa in the first seven-man rugby game.
Earlier in the day, the British team narrowly defeated South Africa by 7:5, which could affect their status in the final.
But in any case, Fiji is now enough to beat a 15-person team with a full spirit.
Tomorrow, at least one Englishman will wear a gold medal, which may be a consolation to the British team, but it may not be. The Englishman, the head of the Fiji team from Wimbledon, was coach 本·瑞恩, who served as England's coach.
It is not easy for the British team to achieve today's results.
Eight years ago, under the coaching of Ryan, they had no victory at the international rugby Sevens game.
Now they are only one step away from the championship.
Although they were hit hard, they made remarkable progress.
Fiji took advantage of the opening, making the British team defenseless.
For Mitchell and his teammates, it's like hitting a series of buses that are moving. The World Series champions have been far ahead of the 5:0 score when 欧西·科林尼索 stormed into the corner flag.
Only four minutes after the game, 杰瑞·图怀 again scored on the right.
12:0, the British team has barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's strong interdiction made the giant Lyon Nakarava not score a third time, but it just slowed Fiji's score.
In 7 minutes, 亚萨·卫莱马鲁 in the right corner. 17:0, the British team to the worse.
That Caravaggio another point, and the game ... 1 minutes left in the first half.
Then, 瓦特莫·拉沃沃 broke through the English team's defense, straight to the scoring line.
At Half-time, the score was 29:0.
The Fijians were born to play 7-man football, and the British team was still a rookie.
This is the case.
The British team made a big change in the second half and hit the Fijian line for four minutes, which was good for the first half. But after the Fiji team played a wonderful match, the 乔舒亚·图埃索瓦 scored again.
丹·诺顿 for the British team to create a scoring opportunity, he touched the ground in the left corner, the score changed to 36:7, but the game has long been in the South China Sea Island control, their fans on the platform singing loudly, waving flags, singing and dancing.
The Fiji team's wonderful performance had to be applaud.
马塔·威廉 at the last minute stopped the Fiji team from an indifferent attack.
The final whistle sounded, the Fijian embraced together, and the defeated British team can only regret the exit.
Earlier in the day, Fiji defeated the Japanese team in 20:5 in the semi-final, while Britain narrowly edged out South Africa in a fierce semi-final clash.
The first half Brown helped South Africa to get ahead, but 丹·诺顿 scored in the second half with a good footwork.
Then England's Anthony's brother, 马库斯·沃森, ensured the team's victory with a brilliant intercept and eventually the British team won the silver medal.
海伦·格 love and 希瑟·斯坦宁, encouraged by the cancer coach, won the rowing gold medal.
It is no exaggeration to say that this is one of the most moving gold medals.
From the first paddle to the present, 海伦·格 love and 希瑟·斯坦宁 have received 220 punitive training, and their gold medal in Estacio da Lagoa has a more remarkable significance.
Though they were the only two to paddle, there was a man on board--coach Robin--who had been accompanying them for the second consecutive women's double paddle Olympic gold medal, which was the UK's first to reach this height of the rowing women's combination.
They have maintained 39 unbeaten records and have an absolute advantage.
What we are seeing is that these two talented athletes are walking gracefully on the water, but this is not the whole of the victory.
There are many volunteers behind every gold medal, and it is their constant devotion that makes a difference, and the greatest help is a coach who learned that he had cancer 30 months ago and did not know if he could live to see the day.
As he said, death may come at any moment.
I had bladder cancer and they operated on me.
If you do not operate, the cancer cells will spread throughout the body.
In this way, the situation will be much worse.
This will change your mind slightly.
Williams was diagnosed with cancer in December 2013.
Luckily, he started treatment in early 2014, minimizing the impact, although in this case it might not be appropriate to say so.
I need to get paid, so I have to be better soon.
It's an inspiration to me.
I live in a hospital, and although they say it's enough to walk a few steps, I walk 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet every time I go around the ward.
This is the beginning of everything.
The rowing movement itself was a journey, which made the journey a little longer.
The first thing they thought of was Williams at the moment of the gold medal. Williams was slightly talkative this morning than usual, to overcome his anxiety.
"I was in a bad mood this week and it might be a bit extreme, but the gold medal really means a lot," said Stanning, who was the head of the Royal Artillery team. ”
It repeatedly told me how important it was to me, how much effort I, Helen, and Robin had made.
This is Helen, Robin and I have been trying for three years in return.
Without Robin, we're just nobody, thank him very much, he's the best coach in the world.
I can't find a better trainer and coach than him.
海伦·格 Love and 希瑟·斯坦宁 were undefeated in five years.
The penalties set by the combination are unmatched by their rivals.
Even at the end of the 500 metres, New Zealand and Denmark are approaching, stanning and Graff still have plenty of physical reserves.
It was so thrilling.
Helen shouted: "Keep the rhythm, keep the rhythm."
It is really important not to be affected by your opponents.
We have a good start, and we are not looking forward to doing something big and earthshaking.
We did not think of today's glory, we just wanted to paddle each oar and win the game, and we did it.
The combination took a year to determine its future.
Graff will marry the TV explorer 史蒂夫·巴克沙尔 next month.
But now, she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I don't want to say it's my last game.
This will bring me too much pressure.
In London, it took me about six months to realize that I was the Olympic champion.
It was a whole new experience and I felt very nervous.
It has now elapsed for about 4 minutes.
"I feel much better," she says. ”

Snapchat's "anime" effect is meant to be ironic to Asians.
Snapchat said the filter was inspired by animation, but some observers thought it was racially colored.
Snapchat's 150 million of everyday users can change the reality through their filter tools and make the person funny.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog, or a 罗伊·利希滕斯坦 painting role.
These lenses have the effect of passivation and bending characteristics, resulting in more than 30 million modified self-portraits per day.
Any mistake will be immediately noticed by the public.
Snapchat lenses have been criticized for being used to agitate to play black or white skin.
So, when the application this week provided a filter for some users to create a squint, a weird tooth, and a powder face effect, some commentators called it a racial satire on Asian "yellow people".
They even think that these recurring problems mean that the company has big problems with diversity.
After Snapchat said it had removed the feature, The Verge and motherboard report sparked outrage in Wednesday.
The company's explanation is that the filter is a tribute to the anime characters, not the irony of Asians.
But for those who have experienced racism, the filter reminds them of a real, hurtful stereotype.
Others are adamantly opposed to these anime images.
A Korean-American art student who published Twitter and was widely shared in the photos said the filters were "at least uncomfortable and uncomfortable".
She added: "It is difficult to distinguish between the most disgusting Asian satirical images and the effects of filters." ”
Although the filter is not only yellow people, but the yellow people are extremely degraded.
Snapchat is not the only company that touches the bottom line of these cultures.
From corporate boardrooms to Hollywood and the equipment we carry, American culture seems to have been advocating diversity and inclusiveness.
Snapchat's vast young population is likely to be very sensitive because of its greater focus on ethnic diversity than the older generation.
When one of Snapchat's filters produced an insult to users, 25-year-old Juketi said in an interview in Thursday: "These things are harder to escape than they were before." ”
Ms Zhu, who acted as product manager and engineer at medium in Thursday, decided to delete her Snapchat account and encourage others to do the same.
In an article written for medium and a telephone interview, she said she thought racial controversy reflected Snapchat's lack of racial diversity in the recruitment process.
Ms. Zhu criticized the company's employees for the majority of whites, and the leadership was all male and added a label at the end of the article: #DeleteSnapchat.
As a Chinese-American, Ms Chu said: "Either they don't have a variety of people in their workforce, so they can make this decision, or there are some colored people in their staff, but their jobs won't let them speak freely." ”
Other observers shared complaints that she had not been Snapchat to respond to.
The company did not release data on the diversity of its workforce and said it was a private company.
Snapchat declined to discuss the ethnic background of its employees in Thursday, but a spokeswoman said the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on the lower-level population and to promote internal inclusiveness.
Ms Zhu said she would close her Snapchat account: "I wonder if they need more users like us to oppose this behavior." ”
Congressional panel says military officials distort ISIS's intelligence
A congressional team in a report released in Thursday noted that U.S. Central Command officials have changed intelligence reports, describing the war situation in Iraq and Syria against Islamic countries as more optimistic than the actual situation.
The interim report comes from a special working group organized by the House Armed Services Committee, the Intelligence Commission and the Republican chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, the Defence Subcommittee. The report said there was "widespread dissatisfaction" among central Command intelligence analysts, who said their superiors were tampering with their assessment of the war between the United States and the Islamic nation.
The Central Command (CENTCOM), located in Florida State Tampa, is the military headquarters responsible for overseeing U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
According to a report on the news, "the intelligence that has been vetted by senior leaders at the Central Command has been more optimistic about U.S. counterterrorism operations than it is, and has always been more optimistic than the analysis of other intelligence agencies." ”
California State Republican representative said: "The Central Command's behavior is difficult to accept." One side is that our warriors are suffering from war, and the other side is the wrong analysis of senior policy makers. ”
The leadership issues of the Central Command have been extended to the highest level of the agency.
The report details the long-standing problems of the 2014 and 2015 Central Command in describing and analysing the United States training of Iraqi troops.
While there is no certainty that the Obama administration's top officials have ordered the changes, the analysts feel they are under pressure from Central Command leaders to make them more optimistic about the threat of the Islamic State (ISIS or ISIL), as described in the report.
"In the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and congressional testimony were much more optimistic than they were," the report said. ”
For example, a central command official said publicly that it was possible to take a major military operation to retake Mosul as early as April 2015 or May.
Almawsil, Iraq's second-largest city, is still under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigation, the results are clear," The Kansas Republican Representative, Mike Peo, said in a statement. ”
Since the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, most senior intelligence officers at the U.S. Central Command have manipulated the command's intelligence products, concealing the threat of the Islamic State of Iraq.
The Republican Party has set up a special working group to learn from analysts about Islamic intelligence being manipulated.
As the investigation continues, there will be more discoveries following the report released in Thursday.
The attorney general of the Ministry of Defence also conducted a long-term investigation into the central Command.
Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee published their findings in Thursday, in line with some of the conclusions of the Republican ad Hoc working group.
In a statement, the committee's Democratic leader, Cheandar, said: "During the period from 2014 to 2015, the Central Command developed an overly narrow process for intelligence assessments of Islamic countries and Iraqi peacekeepers." ”
Mr Cheandar says the process "interferes with the release of intelligence", lowers analyst morale and "cannot accept different opinions." ”
But Mr Cheandar and Democrats said they had found no evidence that the White House was trying to put pressure on analysts at the Central Command, and that their conclusions were consistent with "presupposition or political narratives." ”
The Beast Daily reported the preliminary results of congressional investigation in Tuesday.
Last August, the New York Times reported that after receiving a complaint from a central Command analyst, the Pentagon attorney general began an investigation.
Pentagon spokesman Navy Major 帕特里克·埃文斯 said in a statement that the Pentagon did not comment on the congressional report until the Attorney-General's investigation was completed.
But he said: "Experts sometimes disagree over the interpretation of complex data, and intelligence agencies and the Ministry of Defence encourage healthy dialogue on these important national security themes." ”
The impact of the survey exceeded the success of U.S.-led bombing operations in Iraq and Syria, as more and more defense officials claimed.
But last year, these assertions raised questions about the extent to which President Obama could trust the assessment of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas issued by the Central Command.
The criticism of Islamic intelligence was reminiscent of the controversy more than 10 years ago, when Central Command analyst 格雷戈里·胡克 wrote a study that said George Bush's government insisted on sending small troops to Iraq despite the objections of many analysts and gave little consideration to the aftermath of the 2003 invasion.
Mr Hooker played a key role in the opposition to intelligence in the Islamic State.
Last year, officials said Mr. Hooker's team concluded that the air strikes against the Islamic State's refineries did not significantly reduce the economic revenues of terrorist groups, as the terrorist group built a temporary refinery to continue to sell oil on the black market, which was in stark contrast to the announcement.
According to Time Magazine's September report, the Central Command did not disclose the findings.
The commander of Central Command 劳埃德·奥 Austin III was criticized last year after a number of lawyers reviewed the Senate testimony on the overly optimistic assessment of the war.
General Austin retired in April and is now 约瑟夫·沃特尔 to replace his position at Central Command.
US wins four in women's hockey games
In the 6:1 victory over Japan, 凯蒂·巴姆, a triple-A-brace, took the lead in Thursday for the American women's hockey team to help the US team win the Indian team by 3:0.
Two of the five goals were four, but Bam, 27, said she didn't know she was doing so well.
"I know nothing about it," she says. ”
I'm not the kind of person who remembers how many goals I've scored.
What she knows is that the United States team has won four consecutive games in the Olympics and will compete with the team for the first team in England after winning the 2:0 victory over Japan in Thursday.
Britain and the United States were in the first round of the last game in Saturday.
Both teams qualify for the One-fourth finals, which will determine who is the first in the group.
The team that won the first team will avoid the strong Holland team and can go further. The Dutch team is in the first position of another group.
In the Saturday game, the American team created miracles with astonishing performance. The United States was at the bottom of 12 teams in the London Olympics four years ago.
BAM was in the same team.
Bam Cheng, who was the youngest member of the national team to date, was the first to pick up a lacrosse bat (her twin sister in Drexel) at the age of 3 and join the national team at the age of 16.
She missed the 2008 Olympics because she failed to shortlist the final list.
2012, she and her teammates are not optimistic.
The next year, the British 克雷格·帕纳姆 as head coach, everything began to change.
"This is a cultural, psychological and substantive change," says Bam. ”
We had not yet reached the current level in London.
We came to a full end.
In the evening of Thursday, Bam scored first in a near-range backhand.
India's game has not yet won, but the team showed a surprisingly strong fighting spirit and kept the 1:0 score to the end of the third quarter when BAM broke up.
She took the ball along the left side of the stadium long distance strikes, then cut to the middle road, volley net, the United States team 2:0 lead.
梅利萨·冈萨雷斯 scored the last goal in the middle of the fourth quarter.
In the first three victories, the United States scored a goal for the goalkeeper 杰基·布里吉斯 in 0 opponents in this competition.
This time she was an extraordinary play.
BAM, too.
"We are in good shape," Panam says. But how good it is depends on the results of the Saturday game.
The shabby food of the Great Depression during the feast
March 1933, just elected as president of Franklin · 德拉诺·罗斯福 sits in the Oval Office and enjoys his lunch.
As a gourmet, President Franklin Roosevelt liked the cuisine of the five avenues, such as foie gras and Maryland stew.
On that day, his menu was simple: tomato sauce, devil's egg, mashed potatoes and candied pudding for dessert.
"This is to share the joys and sorrows of food with the people who are suffering," 珍·齐格曼 said. ”
Her husband, Cuomo, added: "This also reflects the way Americans eat." ”
The couple, who live in Brooklyn Heights, are food historians.
Mr. Ke's last book, "Fried Chowder", is about American Chinese food, and Ms. Ziegman in her "97 orchards" book to tell the life stories of slum tenants through food.
Their new book, "Sumptuous Feast", will be published in Tuesday by Harper Press, which introduces the history of American food in the Great Depression.
After showing some common insights on food, they met a journalist in Eisemberg's sandwich shop. This simple lunch counter in the Iron district has been open since the economy ran out of 1929.
Ms. Ziegman, 54, ordered a cream cheese and a broken olive sandwich, while the 57-year-old Mr. Ke ordered turkey, mashed potatoes and a vegetable platter.
The reporter ordered a meatloaf, which the couple thought was suitable for discussing the diet during the Great Depression.
"Bread was very popular at the time," Ms. Ziegman said. ”
There were peanut bread, liver bread, and soy bread.
They are made of a raw material and a cheap topping that can be poured on the raw material.
Imagine your dinner is peanuts.
Mr. Ke played a strange picture.
He said: "They must be like lead in your stomach." ”
In the years before the Great Depression, American Dayton was a buffet, especially in the suburbs.
A group of women cooks for male farm workers, with freshly-tested pies for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
In the First World War, it was the Americans who gave food to the hungry Europeans. The feast of Plenty records how the country suddenly ceases to be a place of abundance.
Mr. Ke explained why he and his wife were writing the book: "At the time, food had become the main topic of unhappiness for the American people." ”
Another unpleasant topic is the shabby new food: "Fan food", such as bread and stews, became the main course, and the stew was "the best way to cook leftovers," Ms. Ziegman said, because chefs could use the cream in their sauces to cover up the unpalatable ingredients.
Fresh fruit is replaced by cheap dried fruits.
The meat that has been leading the American table for years has become a rare luxury.
The odd hodgepodge only considers calories, and the first thing people think about is nutrition rather than taste or even basic culinary common sense.
In the process of studying this book, including various recipes, Ms. Ziegman made a baked onion stuffed with peanut oil.
"It's not uncommon at dinner tables," Mr. Ke said. ”
Ms. Ziegman said: "This is too strange."
Peanut oil and grilled onion can not match.
This is the hallmark of many family economic meals.
Family economists influence the country's eating habits, such as the 路易斯·斯坦利, who served as head of the Federal Family Economics Office from 1923 to 1943, which is historically unique.
They publish recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, encouraging women to be "frugal" and daring to turn the cream of spaghetti with carrots and other bad foods into food.
"Sumptuous feast" is a sumptuous "historical treasure".
It is particularly interesting to note the government's response to the hungry people, such as the president's People Herbert Buddha "Other People's things I can not control" attitude.
Although he publicly praised the simple Iowa farmhouse in his childhood, his diet was as fine as a millionaire.
"He likes to eat European-style Western food, such as fish with cucumber sauce," says Mr Ke.
He wore a tuxedo and dined in a gilded restaurant.
He was evidently out of the people.
If not his wife Eleanor encouraged him to set an example in his diet, President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake.
As the book puts it, Ms. Roosevelt's housekeeper had no interest in the taste, so the White House "food is not only the worst food in Washington, but the worst food in the kitchen." ”
When the United States is back to normal, many of the Great Depression-era cuisine is abandoned.
Ms. Ziegman says what is left is our focus on calories and nutrition and the use of science in cooking.
The couple said they had learned more about Ms Ziegman's mother's eating habits when they wrote the book, such as how she had not discarded the food.
"She is very afraid of wasting food," says Mr Ke. ”
Ms. Ziegman recalls: "She actually makes many lives sick." ”
For example, there has been a "cream puff" incident.
After removing the dish, she and Mr. Ke took out a dessert they had prepared at home: This is the preserved pudding that President Roosevelt ate at lunch.
Ms. Ziegman said: "It's called the Candied fruit," and adds that a trendy name for a common dish is "the usual trick."
There is no whipped cream in this dessert, only preserved fruit, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
We all reluctantly pushed the spoon into the sticky brown paste.
Surprisingly, the dessert tasted good.
Mr. Ke ate the second spoon and the third spoon.
He thought it was an acceptable dessert and told his wife: "A bit of walnuts would be better." ”
Gillied gets a lawyer's fee in the fight against Merck's hepatitis C patent
According to a U.S. District Judge, the company has the right to receive a lawyer's fee in a patent lawsuit against hepatitis C, a pharmaceutical company in the United States Merck Group.
In June, after US judges found wrongdoing in Merck, including perjury and other unethical practices, he was exempt from paying $200 million in compensation for Bouvet and Havoni, which violated Merck's two patents.
In a lawsuit in Thursday, U.S. District Judge 贝斯·兰博松·弗里曼 said that Geely did not have to bear the costs incurred by the defence.
Merck is trying to catch up with the new market for hepatitis C drugs. Jim's drugs can cure more than 90% of patients with hepatitis.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gillied and Merck sued each other, claiming that they were an active ingredient in the Geely drug, the owner of Bouvet's laboratory work.
U.S.-backed troops have announced they have recaptured Mambitti from the Islamic State.
A spokesman for the force said in Friday that the remaining Islamist soldiers in the city had all left, and the United States-backed forces had fully controlled the northern city of Manchester, near the Turkish border.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now sweeping through the city after the militants who have been hiding in town have left.
莎兰·达尔维什 of the Syrian Democratic Forces, the Manchester military commission, told Reuters that they had rescued more than 2,000 civilians abducted by militants.
He told Reuters: "The Mann season is all under our control, but we are still sweeping it." ”
The Clintons paid $10.75 million for 2015 years, paying a 34.2% federal tax.
Hillary Clinton published its 2,105-year tax return in Friday, which shows the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband earning $10.75 million in 2015 years and paying a 34.2% federal tax.
In 2015, the Clintons ' charitable donations amounted to $1 million, most of which were donated to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton's speech cost amounted to nearly 5.3 million dollars, The former secretary of state, with a book on her tenure at the State Department, received $3 million from the publisher, Simon and Schuster.
Clinton's running mate, Virginia State Kaine and his wife 安妮·霍尔顿, announced a 10-year tax return.
The two men paid a federal tax of 20.3% in 2015.
Clinton's campaign aide, 詹妮弗·帕尔米耶里, said in a statement: "Hillary Clinton and Kaine will continue to be the benchmark for financial transparency." ”
In stark contrast, Mr. Donald Trump concealed the false reasons and withdrew his previous commitment to publish the tax returns.
Although the law is not required, in accordance with established practice, the United States presidential candidates should disclose their tax returns.
As a New York businessman, Trump and his lawyer used the IRS audit as a reason to refuse to publish a tax return.
Clinton's campaign aide, 伊恩·萨姆斯, said on Twitter that you were the boss and attached a link to the Democratic candidate's tax return.
In Thursday, Trump's special legal advisor, 迈克尔·科恩, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish his tax returns until the audit was completed.
Critics of Trump, including Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and other Republicans in 2012, said Trump's refusal to publish tax returns would raise questions about his net worth, charitable donations, business deals and other relationships, including relations with Russia.
Clinton seized on the issue and launched a network video in Friday highlighting High-profile Democrats urging Trump to announce his tax payments.
She raised the issue in an economic policy speech in Michigan in Thursday.
"For decades, he refused to publish his tax returns as other presidential candidates," she told the crowd. ”
According to the politician's news network, Trump had barely paid a penny in the last two years of the 90, and the New York Times business columnist quoted a number of tax lawyers and accountants in Friday, all of whom said the current situation might remain the same.
Federal taxes have become a big problem in the presidential race.
Clinton named Warren Buffett, a billionaire investor, with a rule guaranteeing that people who earn more than $1 million a year pay at least a 30% tax.
President Obama also supported the proposal.
Last week, Mr. Clinton held a rally at Berkshire Hathaway's Nebraska State Omaha, where Mr. Buffett asked Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Mr. Buffett said he was also being audited by the IRS, and Trump was "scared" not by tax authorities but by voters.
The first tax returns announced by the Clinton campaign group were 2007 years.
The average federal tax rate paid by the Clintons in Chaback, New York, between 2014 and 2007 amounted to about 32%, with a combined tax rate of about 40.5%.
The Clintons ' 2015-year tax returns show that, unlike most Americans, they earn only $100 in wages.
Their main investment is the low cost Index mutual fund, and the Clintons ' dividend and interest income is $109,000.

Jewish film producer criticizes Berlin hotels to delete Israeli phone codes according to Arab customers ' requirements-Reuters News
A French filmmaker with Jewish ancestry told the press that the Kempinski Hotel in Berlin did not list Israel's phone codes and that the hotel staff said it was "demanded" by Arab customers, sparking a public outcry.
克劳德·朗兹曼, author of the Holocaust documentary Holocaust, expressed his disappointment with the Kempinski Hotel and published an open letter in Germany's Frankfurt report.
During the recent stay, Lanzman wanted to find Israel on the list of phone codes provided by the hotel.
But Israel does not have a list of countries where guests can speak directly from the room.
Did Israel disappear in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of Germany?
Lanzman wrote.
Instead, guests can call Israel via the Kempinski Hotel's call center.
To seek an explanation, the filmmaker asked the hotel's front desk.
In his letter, Lanzman said he was "shocked" by the answer he received at the reception desk.
Hotel staff said it was "a deliberate decision by Kempinski Hotel management."
The reason for this is to make the filmmaker angry.
Lanzman quotes the employee as saying: Most of our guests are Arabs and they want to delete the Israeli code. ”
Israel's ambassador to Germany, 雅科夫·哈达斯·汉德尔斯曼, described the incident as "a disgrace", according to the daily newspaper.
We were surprised to learn of the incident.
The matter itself is a huge disgrace.
In Germany and that chain hotel is a disgrace.
There is no need to explain this matter.
"We hope the hotel can draw the right conclusions," the official said.
The incident sparked a heated debate online, and everyone thought it was a scandal.
Some people think that Kempinski hotel is simply to meet the requirements of Arab customers and "grovel."
Another post points to the hotel's "really shameless face", pointing out that the main street in the famous Kurfuerstendamm Street is near a synagogue.
The hotel quickly clarified all charges, claiming that everything was "negligent" and apologized to Lanzman, according to the Der Spiegel report.
"Never issued a direct command to remove Israel from the speed dial list," the newspaper quoted the Kempinski representative as saying.
The newspaper said the Israeli code was added to the list.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets to expel protesting Brazilian students
In São Paulo, Brazil, in Thursday, students clashed with police over the process of protesting the reform of the Government's public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets to expel protesters.
The cause of the incident was the attempt by law enforcement officials to disperse the students, so the police used rubber bullets and tear gas.
Hundreds of of students took part in the parade, expressing their dissatisfaction with the plans.
To save money, Estado De Sao Paulo Governor Ockming plans to close 100 public schools and 300,000 students will be transferred to school.
Some protesting students expressed their dissatisfaction with the temporary President 米歇尔·特梅尔 through graffiti on the wall.
Just a few days before the recent protests, protesters collectively took to the streets to support President Dilma, who was impeached by the state Senate.
Scottish cyclist 卡尔姆·斯 Skinner wins his bicycle gold medal
卡尔姆·斯 Skinner, a Scottish cyclist, last night at the Rio cycling Men's group race helped the trio to defend the Olympic gold medal after the 2012 London Olympics.
The 23-year-old Glasgow cyclist replaced his Scottish compatriot, Sir 克里斯·霍伊, as the backbone of the team. Even the legendary cyclist was proud of the young Skinner who defeated the New Zealand team and returned with honors.
Four years ago, the British team blockbuster, and Hoy won a personal six Olympic gold medal in the fifth piece.
The British team ranked sixth in London's World Cycling Championships in March, and Hoy has since retired. Then, the British team to create brilliant.
During the Beijing Olympics to the London Olympics, the British team's problem was to replace the "first circle of Experts" 杰米·斯塔夫.
That's what the team did when be appeared.
Hoy's retirement also left a blank, and 奇恩·伊玛迪 and 马特·克兰普顿 all wanted to fill the void.
After seeing the potential of Skinner, the British men's team insisted that he be selected for the national team, and Skinner was not in the end.
Skinner's partner is be and Kenny, who won the gold medal with Hoy four years ago. The trio have refreshed the Olympic record in qualifying, but the result was overtaken by New Zealand in the first round.
The three British Cycling championships eventually defeated their opponents and won the gold medal.
Although be is slightly behind, but Kenny is leading the team, Skinner has maintained this leading edge to the last.
The change in strategy was the key to this reversal, and be chose a larger flywheel, so it was slower, which allowed Kenny, especially Skinner, to keep pace.
Hoy watched the game as a BBC commentator. Skinner, Kenny and be saw him on the podium.
"I'm flattered," says Skinner, 23, a Glasgow cyclist. ”
I just try my best to make my own fame.
We created the Olympic record in the final and defeated the world champion.
It's unbelievable.
Nothing is better than this victory.
After winning gold medals with Kenny and Hoy at the 2012 London Olympics, be admits to falling deliberately on the track in a bad start.
Later, he withdrew the comments, and British rivals were unable to appeal.
This victory does not have any such problems.
"It's like London, the British flag on the platform," be says. ”
We just got together three months ago.
We've lost a lot of world champions, so it's amazing to be able to defend the Olympic champions.
It's just a game, a gold medal for the British team who won 7 of the 10 gold medals in the Beijing Olympics and the London Olympics.
If this symbolizes the progress we have made over the past five months, we will continue to be successful at the bicycle museum in the next five days.
According to Kenny Dalglish, it is not impossible for him to recreate Hoy's feat of winning three gold medals at an Olympic Games.
If so, 12 years younger than Hoy and also on March 23 (a day that seems to be the holy day of British sports, 史蒂夫·雷德格雷夫, 莫·法拉 and Bannister were born on this day) Kenny will have 6 golds and 1 silver medals.
This achievement is flat with Hoy.
Kenny is going to start the three-day race today.
The 28-year-old Bolton said: "I will focus on this game for the time being."
Team games are always the best.
You can win the game with your teammates.
Frankly speaking, a person wins a little lonely.
Be said: "If he can win another two gold medals, then he should be awarded the Jazz seal number." ”
It was the only game to produce medals that day, but the British team received other good news.
Sir Bradley, 艾德·克兰西, 史蒂文·伯克 and 欧文·杜尔 to the fastest score of four people four km group chase.
Their grades were 351.943.
The world record for the 2012 London Olympic gold medalist was 351.659.
The first and final (10:42) in today's second match day, Wiggins will undoubtedly become the focus of the limelight.
Yesterday he had a dispute with the match officials before qualifying, when the match officials asked him to measure his height.
劳拉·特洛特, 乔安娜·罗瑟尔·尚德, Eleanor 诺·巴克 and 凯特·阿奇博尔德 from Milngavie in a new world record 413.260 for the women's team, which will end tomorrow.
The British team relied on a strong field bike team to take the initiative in the middle of the Olympic Games and get many medals.
The British Cycling team was a little disappointed when they went to Rio to show their absolute dominance in the Beijing and London Games.
Many setbacks occurred during the period, including the resignation of April technical director 肖恩·萨顿 for sex discrimination and bullying, and the retirement of legendary figures such as Hoy and 维多利亚·彭德尔顿.
But the first game of the Bicycle Pavilion was enough to show that the British team will once again play a key moment to reach the pinnacle of the legend.
Future of the Portland smelter is fraught with uncertainty due to the cancellation of the power supply contract
As the factory-powered power company disclosed that a factory owner would terminate a supply contract to invalidate all supply contracts, the hundreds of workers at the Portland aluminium smelter in Victoria and the factory are facing an uncertain future.
The move comes after the Victorian government decided not to continue to subsidize factory operations.
The 20-year fixed subsidy will expire in November.
2000 workers at Alcoa's Portland plant may face unemployment.
As soon as the factory closes, there may be as many as 2000 people directly or indirectly unemployed.
And because the plant uses about 10% of all of Victoria's electricity output, it may also have a ripple effect.
Alcoa closed the Hanry Kok smelter in 2014, leading to the closure of the Anglesey power plant last year.
Alcoa's Portland smelter is currently losing money and facing a risk of closure.
The move comes after a forecast for the factory in the next few years, initially because of the strength of the Australian dollar and, more recently, the price of the factory's products.
AGL supplies electricity to the large aluminium smelter through the Latrobe Valley old Eyang power plant. The company predicts that three other factory owners will also terminate their agreement.
The largest shareholder in the plant is a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, while China's Citic Group and Japan's Marunouchi company also hold a small stake.
"AGL expects the Portland plant to continue operating, which means the smelter will continue to generate electricity demand," the joint venture said. ”
AGL said the contracts were "hedging contracts" that should have been in force since November 2016.
The termination period of the contract is 12 months, so they will terminate in 2017.
"Therefore, AGL still predicts that these contracts will continue to generate revenue in fiscal year 2017," the power company said. ”
Any revenue impact on AGL from the fiscal year 2018 is now a bullish outlook for wholesale electricity prices in the futures market.
AGL said the company had reduced its contract value by $187 million in "ending activity expectations".
Alcoa said the decision to terminate the contracts "will not affect Alcoa's ability to operate the smelter or to guarantee the smelter's power supply."
The US company said it signed a 20-year contract with old Eyang in 2010, which would have come into effect in November this year, but the company did not explain why the contract was withdrawn.
Analysts caution about whether the Tomago plant in Victoria's Portland smelter and near NKSR will be closed because of the industry's dire economic situation.
In response to analysts ' comments earlier this week, AGL operations director 史蒂芬·米克尔森 said Portland's electricity consumption reached about 600 megawatts a year, and the Tomago plant reached about 900 megawatts.
If two factories shut down, the demand for electricity market will be greatly reduced.
"It's not good news for us as a power company," he says.
Community Law Center shuts 160,000 people out every year
Every year more than 160,000 of the most vulnerable groups are shut out of Community law centres. The service is already overstretched and now faces further capital cuts.
In Queensland, three out of every five persons were rejected in the search for free legal advice and agency services, most of them elderly, migrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those who did not have the resources to fight unjust evictions.
The lack of funding for community legal Services has already exceeded the limit and now faces further capital cuts.
The federal government's funding for these legal centres will be reduced by another 30% per year since June.
詹姆斯·法雷尔, head of the Queensland Community Law Center, said thousands of people were turned away every year according to the latest National Community Association Law Center Investigation report.
Mr Farrell says the situation will only get worse if the federal government does not change the existing decision.
"The Queensland Community Law Centre is chronically underfunded, which means thousands of people will not be able to get the essential services they need," he said. ”
People who need to stay away from violence, those who are burdened with huge debts, families that are falling apart, and squeezed workers face legal problems, and the report shows that they are unable to get the help they need.
The federal government will cut back 30% of its funding since June 2017, which means thousands of vulnerable groups in Queensland will be forced to face complex legal problems without help.
We call on the Attorney-General and Queensland Congressman 乔治·布兰迪斯 to withdraw the money-cutting decisions immediately so that people can get the help they need in the face of legal problems.
Last year, the state pledged to raise legal aid funds to the national average.
Attention must now be paid to the needs of Community law centres and their corresponding communities, and the Bai government must also devote itself to this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign team is being sued for pulling guns
NEW York: Trump's campaign team was charged with pulling a gun at a worker when he was driving a Jeep in February.
文森特·博迪尼, a former software trainer for the state's campaign team, described the incident in a state court in Charlotte in Wednesday.
Mr. Bodini said he had hoped the affair would be resolved internally, but he realised "it is not likely to happen" after months of waiting.
According to Bodini's description, the person named 厄尔·菲利普 "pulled out a pistol, put his right forefinger on the board and pointed the muzzle at Vincent's knee bone." ”
After complaining to the local and regional campaign leadership, Bodini learned from the file that at least four other people had gone through the same thing.
Bodini said in a complaint: "No shooting does not mean that it will not cause harm." ”
Just two days before the case, the Republican presidential candidate told the crowd in North Carolina State that if his rival Hillary Clinton was elected and chose her favourite judge, the "people who support the Second Amendment", the gun holder and gun enthusiast, might act, sparking outrage.
Trump's campaign team said the media had taken the word out of his words and he did not advocate violence.
In a complaint, Bodini asked the campaign team to compensate for his oversight, while also demanding that Philip compensate for his attacks, beatings and mental injuries.
Trump spokesman 霍普·希克斯 did not immediately respond to the news.
Could not reach Philip.
Philip recently left the campaign team, according to WCCB, a local news agency in Charlotte.
His consulting firm Innovative Consulting Services did not immediately respond to calls.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's campaign team is under controversy.
Both sides of the case are Bodini and Trump presidential campaign company, 16-cs-14300, Mecklenburg County (Charlotte) High Court general Chamber.
Britain must deliver Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow Airport
Heathrow will also bring dynamism and prosperity to our communities, London and the country as a whole.
For me, this is Heathrow's charm, just as we did our best to ensure that our country and region benefited from these events at the 2012 London Olympics.
The Olympics have benefited Stratford and the east side.
And we will create opportunities for the local people and businesses around Heathrow to benefit the region again.
As far as our local community is concerned, we will create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and get the young people around the airport out of the unemployment trap.
Just before the 2012 London Olympics, some people thought Heathrow's expansion was too big.
I was told that Britain would not be ready for the Olympics and that we would lose face all over the world.
Sceptics are wrong about the 2012 Olympics, and their suspicions of Heathrow will prove wrong.
While there will always be hurdles to overcome, Heathrow is tackling every problem it faces.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is a infrastructure project for most people rather than a few.
The expansion will create up to 180,000 new jobs and bring in 211 billion of pounds of economic growth, leaving a technology and employment fortune around the airport and across the UK.
We have an excellent Heathrow project team. The team has completed a 11 billion-pound infrastructure investment project on time and within budget, including the T5 terminal, which has been elected to the world's best airport terminal for five consecutive years, and the T2 terminal between the two busiest runways in the world.
Now they are preparing to build a third runway with a private investment of £ 16 billion.
Britain successfully hosted the 2012 London Olympics, and I believe the Heathrow Airport expansion will be a great success.
Now is the time for us to deliver the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, so that we can escort our future and create a wealth of technology and employment that prides the whole of Britain.
Lord 保罗·戴顿 is the chairman of the Heathrow Airport board and the former British Treasury commercial counsellor
A woman killed herself and died on a Swiss motorway.
The victim lay on the motorway at midnight.
The woman who tried to kill himself was run over by several cars on the motorway in the early Thursday. The police are now looking for witnesses.
The accident occurred on the A1 Highway near Vaud/waadt in early Thursday.
Vaud/waadt police said a woman was "hopelessly" lying on the road in the middle of the night and was run over by several vehicles.
The victim, a 49-year-old Swiss woman, had apparently committed suicide attempts. She was run over by many cars, including a lorry.
The woman died on the spot.
Police have revealed that a number of drivers have been investigated, but some drivers have not yet confirmed. Police are now calling on them and witnesses to the accident to be investigated.
吉勒斯·霍夫 Steiter, a lawyer for the Geneva Tribune, indicated that criminal investigations had been initiated, a routine process for such incidents.
But it is not yet known whether there will be drivers facing charges.
Is it possible to avoid collisions?
"This will be determined by the prosecutor," said Hough Steiter.
According to the results of two similar cases in the past five years, drivers will not be liable.
Both cases were caused by the fact that someone had taken to the motorway late at night, according to the report. The final verdict was that the pilot could not have foreseen that pedestrians would cross the highway at midnight.
Last year, a police officer was charged with negligence for death, alleging that in August 2014, she hit a man and died on the A1 highway near payer.
The court learned that the 22-year-old victim had been drinking and crossing the road.
After the investigation, the judge said that the woman policeman's driving was perfectly legal and that the man appeared on the road "completely unexpected and unpredictable", and the policewoman later dialed the emergency call.
Anyone who can provide information about the accident near the Thursday Moore Day should call 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44 contact police.
NASA climate model: Venus was once fit for human habitation
According to NASA's new climate model, Venus has been fitted for human habitation.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Space Institute have developed a model to explore the past of Venus, which uses tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model is used to determine whether Venus, which has high surface temperatures, no water and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, has ever had a similar Earth-like environment.
Earlier, scientists believed that Venus ' rotation was slower because of its thicker atmosphere.
But the latest simulations suggest that Venus may have had a thinner, Earth-like atmosphere and at that time rotated at a slower rate.
The model also shows the early terrain of Venus.
Venus may have more dry areas than Earth, but there has been enough water and geographical changes to nurture life and prevent rapid evaporation.
In the early days, the sun shone on Venus 30% brighter than the Earth.
"The slow rotation of Venus at the Goddard Space Institute has made the day nearly two months on one side," 安东尼·德尔·杰尼奥, a scientist at the Goddard Space Institute, explained at a news conference. ”
This warms the surface and produces rain that can form thick clouds, which are like an umbrella that blocks most of the sun's heat.
The result of the simulation is that the average weather temperature of Venus is actually a few degrees lower than the current Earth.
The model simulates the evolution of Venus similar to that previously speculated by planetary scientists.
Although there may have been life on Venus, Venus has been exposed to high temperatures and ultraviolet rays in the course of billions of years.
The oceans on the planet evaporate and the water vapor is burned out by ultraviolet rays.
As hydrogen escapes, it leaves only a thicker carbon dioxide atmosphere and a lethal greenhouse gas effect, which forms what we know today about Venus.
The researchers published the results of the new Venus Climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Newsletter.
帕特里克·罗伊 resigned as Avalanche manager
帕特里克·罗伊 resigned as manager and vice president of the Colorado Avalanche ice hockey team in Thursday, saying he had no say in the team's decision-making level.
乔·萨奇斯, executive vice president of Colorado, confirmed the news and said the club would immediately start looking for a new manager.
"Over the past three years, I have been active, passionate and determined to fulfill the responsibilities of the Colorado Avalanche coach and vice president," Roy, 50, said in a statement. ”
I've been thinking about how to improve this team throughout the summer and make it more powerful.
To this end, the goal of the manager and vice president must be consistent with the goals of the club.
He must also have a say in the decisions that affect the team's performance.
But these conditions are not yet met.
Sachs, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
Sachs said: "Patrick told me his decision today." ”
We thanked him for the contribution he made to the club and hoped that he would be smooth sailing in the future.
Roy was nominated as the best coach of the 杰克·亚当斯 Award league in his first season with the 2013-14-year-old avalanche team.
He helped the club gain 112 points, ranking first in the Central Division. But the Colorado team was knocked out by Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs and missed the playoffs in the last two average.
2015-16 season, the Avalanche team's result is 39 wins 39 flat 4 negative, finally has lost the Western Big League division second card qualifications in the 5 points difference.
As goalkeeper of the Hall of Fame, Roy has won four Stanley Cups, each with two seats for the Montreal Canadian team and the Avalanche team.
North Sea oil workers stop strike and continue negotiations
The chief negotiator said workers at the North Sea oil field had halted the pay strike, and the parties to the dispute began a new round of negotiations.
A number of strikes against Wood Group, the Oil-field Service company, have appeared on the North Sea oil platform operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
According to a joint statement, "Wood Group and the Unite and RMT unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the current dispute resolution process." ”
We will revisit these issues from the beginning of next week with a number of all-day meetings in the coming weeks.
The union said it had recently taken action to protest the highest possible pay cut of 30% per cent, which was the first by the Union since 25.
Wood Group has reduced the compensation for North Sea contractors by about 9% this year due to market pressure.
Prior to the pay cut, the company lowered its offshore contractor's pay by 10% in 2014.
The company said another pay cut would help the company tide over the market depression.
Shell has cut thousands of of its staff and announced plans to shut down 10 of its oil and gas facilities because it needs to streamline its operations after it merged with British Gas group, a UK energy company.
Energy companies are under pressure from a drop in crude oil prices and the UK's decision to take off Europe in June.
戴夫·安德森, a member of the Scottish Parliament, met with union leaders earlier this week to discuss the biggest labor dispute in the North Sea generation.
He says the North Sea is crucial to the region's economy.
"In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that serves the majority, not the few," Dave said in a statement. ”
The new North Sea project was expected to spend no more than $1.4 billion in 2016, while the average project expenditure in the past five years amounted to about $7 billion.
Kepler measures the rotational speed of a star in a Pleiades cluster
The latest mission of the Kepler space telescope has helped astronomers capture the most complete star rotation rate in the Pleiades.
The new data are helping astronomers understand why stars in the cluster have different rotational velocities and the correlation between the rotation cycle and the planet's composition.
"We hope to further understand the relationship between stellar mass, age, and even the history of the solar system by comparing our results with other clusters," said 卢萨·雷布尔, a researcher at the Center for Infrared processing and analysis at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. ”
The Pleiades is 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster were born about 125 million years ago and have just reached adulthood.
They reach the highest rotational speed in their lifetimes.
At the highest rotational speed, these mature stars shoot a large number of stellar winds.
When these stellar winds travel through the magnetic field of a star, they can produce a braking effect on the star.
As the age of the star increases, its rotational speed begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotational velocities of the stars by tracking the time that a recognizable stellar sunspot (like sunspots) appears.
The latest rotational velocity datasets show that the larger stars have a slower rotation rate than the smaller stars.
Raible compares a star to a dancer, and a larger dancer spins slower than a smaller dancer.
"In the ' ballet ' of the Pleiades, we found that stars with slower rotation tend to be of greater mass, and the fastest-spinning stars tend to be the lightest stars," says Raible. ”
Because the Pleiades cluster is close to each other, it can serve as an ideal cosmic laboratory for comparing stellar mass with rotational velocities.
"The Pleiades has laid the foundation for a two-way spin theory model for Young and aging stars," Raible said. ”
We still have a lot of knowledge about how stars, when and why they slow their rotation and "put away their own dancing shoes."
Raible and her colleagues elaborated on their latest analysis of the rotational speed of the Pleiades in three new papers. The three papers will soon be published in the Journal of the day literature.
