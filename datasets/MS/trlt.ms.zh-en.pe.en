28-year-old chef was found dead in a San Francisco shopping mall
A 28-year-old chef who had recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a local mall this week.
But the victim's brother said he could not think of anyone that would want to harm his brother and said "everything is finally getting better.""
The San Francisco Coroner's office said that the body found at Westfield Shopping Center on Wednesday morning was identified as Frank Galicia, 28 years old, a San Francisco resident.
The San Francisco police station said the death was a homicide and is under investigation.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC station KGO in San Francisco that Frank, previously a line cook in Boston, had landed his dream job as line chef at San Francisco's Sons &amp; Daughters restaurant six months ago.
A spokesman for the Sons &amp; Daughters restaurant said they were "very shocked" by Frank's death.
The spokesman said, "We were a small team of people who got along like a close family, we will miss him deeply."
At this difficult time, our thoughts and condolences are with Frank's family and friends.
Louis Galicia said Frank was originally living in a guest house, but recently "everything was getting better."
"He found an apartment, he was dating a girl," Louis Galicia told KGO."
Louis Galicia said he could not think  of anyone who would want to harm his brother.
Frank has a good heart and a broad mind.
Louis Galicia said: "Frank often cooked dinner for his family."
He never wanted to quarrel with his family.
He is a man who goes with the flow.
"With everything else in the world  is likely to be wrong, Frank, with rough appearance but intelligence inside, was a person shining like diamond everyday." Louis Galicia said."

Junior doctors strike: Calls for new labor movement
Representatives of junior doctors have called on their union to authorize fresh industrial action in their dispute about a new contract.
The junior doctors committee  of the British Medical Association  is to ask its full council to back more strikes from early September.
The junior doctors' committee said the ministers did not solve their concerns about the contract.
Junior doctors and medical students voted in July to reject the contract deals between the government and the British Medical Association.
Of the members who participated in the vote, 58% opposed the contract.
In a letter addressed to Twitter on Thursday night, Ellen McCourt, chairman of the Junior Medical Council, said that the government "has always remained silent" for the problem that have led to a boycott of the contract.
"In view of this, the Executive Committee of the Junior Medical Council voted unanimously to reject the proposed new contract and called for a formal resumption of consultations on all their concerns," she said."
In response to the government's silence, the executive committee of the Junior Medical Council has formally requested the British Medical Association Council to convene a special meeting to approve a long-term plan aimed at upgrading labor operations from early September.
The dispute has led to junior doctors taking part in six strikes this year, including the first all-out stoppages in the history of the NHS.
Dr. Johann Malawana, the leader of the British Medical Association, resigned after the boycott of the agreed terms of the contract recommended by the British Medical Association.
He had told BMA members the deal was a good one that should be accepted, during meetings ahead of the poll of 54,000 junior doctors and medical students.
After the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said that the contract would be enforced among England health care workers.
Russia and Turkey: An "alliance of misfit"?
A gesture ends a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday. They shook hands and announced a formal end to an eight-month long war of words and economic sanctions.
But, as Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of a St. Petersburg palace, I got the distinct impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.
Yes, the two parties do shake hands.
But Mr Putin's smile looked thin and he was hardly oozing warmth even by his own restrained standards.
According to reports, Recep Tayyip Erdogan referred to his "dear friend" Mr. Putin five times.
I can not remember.
At the same time, he promises to restore the relations with Russia back to level before the crisis, or even higher.
The next day, one newspaper here described Mr Erdogan as acting as if nothing bad had ever happened.
But I think his enthusiasm implied something opposite.
However, Mr. Putin's continued indifferent attitude shows that he has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening comments: Turkey shot down a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction was intense.
Mr. Putin furiously criticized the incident, accusing Ankara of plotting against Moscow.
The attack from the so-called friends is even more difficult to accept.
It is difficult or even impossible for both parties to restore mutual trust.
The polls in Russian show a twist turn since the beginning of November.
Over the past few months, the government-controlled media had been making a set of all-out shocking attacks on Ankara.
Suddenly, the Turks seem to be responsible for everything.
Most serious accusations comes from top officials, saying that Mr Erdogan and his family has profited from illegal oil trades from ISIS-held territory.
He has denied this outright.
But messages from St. Petersburg suggest that it's time to move on.
After all, this meeting only happened because Mr Putin received the apology he demanded from President Erdogan.
Russia can declare victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire are very clear.
Of first importance, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he was nearly ousted from power last month in a failed coup.
The frequent terrorist attacks have made a big impact on him.
But also has economic motives.
Russian sanctions are a big hit against Turkey, especially for charter flights that can transport millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The figure has fallen sharply by nearly 90%.
With the resumption of flights, the Russian travel agencies and charter companies will breathe a sigh of relief.
They will meet the Mediterranean tourism tide at the end of the season.
State television station even predicts  this week that the prices of fruits and vegetables will decrease once Turkey's agricultural products  are reopened to import,
A report of Moscow newspaper Vedemosti said: "tourists gone, tomato came back.""
For Moscow, the visit also has additional political value.
Ankara was angry at the weak reaction of the Western world at the take over.
Besides,  Ankara has long-standing grudge at the snail's pace of talks to join the EU and step in Mr Putin - who is keen to capitalist on the chill and chip away at Turkey's ties with the West.
Due to their endorsement for the elected government after the coup failed, the Russian leaders are bound to gain Ankara's extra points.
Please note that this is a gift for Moscow, which always has a deep-rooted fear of regime change.
Thus, the meeting held in this magnificent seaside palace made Russia and Turkey, two countries that were rejected and ill-treated by the Western world, formed an ally, and an analyst described this as the "outsider league".
However, there are still major differences between the two sides despite public reconciliation.
Syria is one of the key factors.Moscow has recently played a peacekeepingg role in Syria, while Russia and Turkey have supported the opposite faction.
It is predictable that after almost three hours of initial talks, the two presidents tell a press conference that they haven't even touched on that topic.
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question on their differences, while Mr Putin chose to highlight it.
The two sides have reached a clear consensus on how to seek common ground while reserving differences on the Syrian issue.
But after months of open hostility,  and given the potential for utter disaster when NATO member Turkey shot down that Russian fighter jet, it is certainly better now that the two leaders are at least talking again.
Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer serve customers outside of Scotland
According to CEO of the Royal Bank of Scotland, the bank will be simplified as a logistical organization.
Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer serve customers outside of Scotland.
Ross McEwan told the BBC Scottish division that the Royal Bank of Scotland brand had been committed to its global ambitions.
But eight years ago on the brink of collapse, had to accept the rescue since then began to give up that pursuit.
During that time, brand strategists have used 'RBS' to protect other consumer finance brands.
The group committed millions of pounds to sponsoring international sport, from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now, the correct way is to let more national brands come to fore.
Royal Bank of Scotland will serve Scottish customers, but will not be restored to its original status.
In England and Wales, all references, outside headquarters and the listing on stock exchanges, will be changed to National Westminster Bank.
The Alster Bank brand has been used by customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller yet more prominent private banking brands, such as Coutts, Adam &amp; Co., Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr. McEwan has been  interviewed at the Inverness County during a customer and staff tour.
"The Royal Bank of Scotland brand will eventually become our investor brand and one of the best employees' brands," he told the BBC Scottish division, "as we are now a bank with a lot of brands.""
As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS also became a global brand.
I'm now saying we are no longer focused on global but local.
Each brand has its own differentiation representing its own industry, and our employees can serve our customers in different industries through different brands.
Royal Bank of Scotland had already stated that it would not to continue its Six Nations sponsorship, and it has been raising the profile of different brands in its sports sponsorship.
"It's time for us to move to the bank of brands, because we've been asking how do we focus on making this a better bank for customers on the side?" said the chief executive."
If our determination of becoming a gigantic bank with various brands three years ago would be jeered at,
At the moment, we focus on customer needs, and I believe you already have noticed these changes.
We can relaunch these brands, so I think the time is right.
Dettori won his 3,000th career race with Predilection at Newmarket.
Dettori sprays champagne after two victories at Newmarket take him to 3,000 wins.
On Friday, professional jockey  Frankie Dettori scored his 3,000th victory at Newmarket.
He used Predilection who was trained by trainer John Gosden to ride on the track and won twice in the evening, and achieved the 3,000th win of his career.
The 45-year-old Italian is in sixth position in a level field achieving a milestone as a professional horse racing jockey.
The top five respectively are: Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
Three-time champion jockey Dettori, who earlier won on Ghayyar, said: "It is special.""
I am very excited because my family is also on the scene
I am happy with my achievements at Newmarket, because I started from here 30 years ago.
It was not a big jockey tournament, nor the Royal Ascot, this is just an ordinary Friday night with 20,000 spectators.
I am very pleased and very humble.
Dai Tuli received the Predilection after winning, causing the audience to cheer
In the field of obstacle courses, two jockeys have achieved this achievement, they are the champion jockey Richard Johnson (Richard Johnson) and now retired winner of 20 championships Sir Anthony McCoy (Anthony McCoy), of which Sir McCoy had more than 4,300 victories in his record-breaking career.
Berger is a nine-time champion of Derby match, and he has a total of 4,493 wins in his professional career.
Chartly is the best jockey at the present so it was not surprising that he had made this milestone, few have achieved this before him.
He is stylish and strong, but it is his tactical nous that make him outstanding from others in the weighing room.
He is a great equestrian ambassador, his enthusiasm and charisma have been drawing fans to the sport for years.
I side to Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom, he'd have reached 6,000 victories if he wasn't just a weekend and big-race jockey!
Honestly, Dettori can be called the best horse racing jockey in the United Kingdom in the past 30 years, which is very significant.
His character is lively, which is a good thing for the British horse racing field, but besides this, he is an incredible jockey.
Dai Li Li celebrated this milestone with its iconic jump horse action
From jumping to the finish line to jumping off the horse, Dettori has always been an archetype of UK flat horse racing for two decades.
His career has been a roller coaster.
He won several championships, including his famous "seven-game winning streak" at Royal Ascot in 1996. However, he also suffered a crash and served a drugs ban.
Three years ago, he initially struggled when returning from the six-month suspension.However, he showed formidable strength of character to defy the doubters and return to his best.
He e may not be done for some time - Dettori has previously said he would like to carry on competing until the age of 50, at least.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has dismissed chief of staff, Sergei Ivan.
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly fired  Sergei Ivanov as Director of the Office of the President.
Over the years, Mr. Ivanov has always been a key member of the core group that Mr. Putin trusts most.
The 63-year-old Ivanov has now been made a special representative for environmental and transport issues.
A statement from the Kremlin said that Mr Putin had "decreed to relieve Ivanov of his duties as head of the Russian presidential administration," but didn't give a reason.
Anton Vaino, who has served as deputy for Mr. Ivanov since 2012, has been appointed as his successor.
Mr Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
He was born in Tallinn, Estonia, in 1972, graduated from the prestigious Moscow International Institute of International Relations (MGIMO),  and had worked at the Tokyo Embassy.
Later he managed presidential draft and government staff, says the Kremlin website (in Russian).
After being appointed, he expressed his gratitude to Mr Putin: "Thank you for your trust.""
I think the most important task of this government is to support the head of state in drafting laws and implementing rules.
Mr Putin told a Russian TV station on Friday that Mr. Ivanov had asked to leave the post, and recommended that Mr. Vaino should replace him.
Is this smile convincing?
Moscow was puzzled by the move.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin's closest assistants and, like him, served in the Soviet security service, the KGB.
As chief of staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
In a meeting with President Putin shown on state television, both men claimed that the chief of staff was stepping down at his own request.
Despite the smile in front of the camera, no one is convinced - especially in this time of  parliamentary elections.
So, is this the result of the failure in some power struggle?
Not yet known.
However, the official statement - that a presidential candidate suddenly chose to take over Russia's environmental policy - caused many doubts.
In remarks to Mr Putin, quoted on the Kremlin website, Mr Ivanov said "it's true that in early 2012 I asked you, in a conversation, to entrust me with this very complicated post  - you even could say - troublesome post, for four years."
"The result is that I have been the Director of the Office of the President for four years and eight months."
Mr. Ivanov served  in this post in December 2011.
Prior to that, he served as Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister.
He is a member of the Security Council of the Russian Federation and,  just like Mr. Putin, is a former agent of the National Security Agency.
In the late 1990s, when Mr Putin was head of the Federal Security Service (FSB, a successor to the KGB), Mr Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
After Mr Putin took office, he appointed Mr. Ivanov as one of the five people he most trusted.
It was once thought that Mr Ivanov might become president of Russia after Mr Putin's second term, because a third term for Mr Putin would have been unconstitutional.
But that position was taken by another close Putin ally, Dmitry Medvedev.
Mr. Putin served as Prime Minister of Russia, before returning to the presidency just three-and-a-half years later.
The mysterious fish appeared at Banff- a garden
A Banff man has appealed for help in identifying fish that have appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks the 75 fish may be sand eels brought by sea tornadoes.
Mr. Bain lives about 500m from the sea. He posted footage of this strange scene on Periscope, hoping that someone can shed light on the appearance of the two-inch fish.
Queens ferry Crossing  Bridge now has been connected to Fife
The £1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017.
Engineers have connected the North Bridge of Queensferry Crossing with viaduct, which means that the bridge is getting through to Fife.
The four "bridge wind turbines" near the three bridgeheads of each bridge are now nearing completion, and the project is the first bridge.
The bridge, which starts at Fife, is 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 metric tons.
It used 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tonnes of concrete and 46 stay-cables.
The £ 1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed in May 2017.
Economy Minister Keith Brown visited the site today and was among the first to cross the bridge.
"This is a historic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Crossing, "he said."
We're all witnessing the engineering on such a truly epic scale on this project, with over 30,000 tonnes of concrete and steel used just to build this part of the bridge.
Although the bridge is very large and heavy, joining the viaduct and roadway is a meticulous operation, requiring precise assembly.
Overall, nearly 79% of the total bridge deck is now in place, the final section of deck is having its concrete deck cast in Rosyth today, meaning all the deck is ready to be lifted into place on the bridge.
"In any bridge construction program, the final closure is always one significant milestone", said Michael Martin, project director for the QueensFerry Crossing."
On this fantastic project, this closure represents cutting-edge civil engineering.
After installing the last deck section and connecting it to the expanded North Bridge road deck, what come next is to join the gaps on the north side, i.e. the landward side.
To complete this operation we need pull the northern approach viaduct 700 millimeters southwards.
This was a massive and, at the same time, very delicate operation.
It is huge because the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 metric tons, and needs to be pulled out of a slope of about 3%.
It is precise because the engineering team needs to make sure that the deviation is very small, with only a few millimeters on each side.
It is gratifying that everything is going well.
Simone Biles nails all-around champion in women's gymnastics.
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles has not been affected by any of these.
Vault horse with lots of vitality .
She acted at ease on the balance beam.
What a stunning gymnastics floor exercise.
The overall performance is very exciting.
Finally became the Olympic champion now.
The 19-year-old American gymnast won the all-around championship on Thursday, demonstrating her world-leading talent in gymnastics.
She won with a total score of 62.198, which is higher than silver medalist and "Final Five" team member Aly Raisman and bronze medalist Russian player Aliya Mustafina.
On Thursday, Simone Biles from the United States performs on the balance beam during the artistic gymnastics women's individual all-around final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Simon Biles helped the US team take home the gold medal of the Olympic Women's Gymnastics Individual All-around four times in a row. She personally won five medals in the Olympic Games, further fortifying that she is the best of her generation and perhaps ever.
When he saw his total score, Beiers could not help but shed tears.She finally ended this long journey.
Beiers is among "the athletes of decades", the same as  Michael Phelps. Both of them have improved their respective areas of sports to a new height:
Biles has been dominating her sport for the last three years, winning 15 world championship medals, including ten gold.She trained industriously with a great ambition to achieve a better precision.1984 Olympic gold medalist Mary Lou Retton said: "Biles is the best gymnast I've ever seen."
There is the last game in Brazil, but this game is more about a battle between Bayer herself and the great expectations upon her, rather than a contest between Bayer and other gymnasts.
If Beiers did not have a gold medal back to her home in Spring, Texas, everyone would be very disappointed.
Simon Beers (left) from the United States and Lisman hugged each other. The two respectively won gold and silver medals in the Racing Gymnastics Women's Individual Finals of the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in August (Thursday).
Beiers won the first gold medal on Tuesday, giving retired national team coach Karolyi (Martha Karolyi) a pleasant gift on her farewell party.
While Biles insisted she's never looked ahead during her long run at the top, that's not exactly true.
A portion of her floor exercise routine - the one that includes her signature tumbling pass - is set to Latin music that she usually listens to at home one street away from the Rio Olympic Arena.
This is no coincidence.
The girl, adopted by her grandparents as a toddler and discovered by coach Aimee Boorman's mother during a field trip to the gym where Boorman was coaching, has become a force.
She hasn't lost an all-around competition since the summer of 2013, a winning streak that should go for as long as Biles wants it to.
Mustafina took a small lead through two gyrations, but it was a mirage.
Balance beam and floor exercise - where Biles is the defending world champion - lay in wait.
Her balance wood score was 15.433, and a free gymnastics score of 15.933.
While waiting for the final score Lesman gave Beiers a gentle hug.When Beiers learned that he had achieved his dream result, he cried.
Raisman's performance was a bit of revenge from four years ago, when she tied for third but lost the bronze to Mustafina on a tiebreaker.
But this time, this 22-year-old captain, dubbed "Grandma" by the Americans, was way ahead of the pack.
She blew kisses at the crowd after completing floor exercise to declare her return, but some former returns like this seems to be dubious.
Byers is just 19 years old.From earlier this week, the news spread  like a virus on Twitter.For Biles, her life has been given a whole new meaning.
6-year-old Mahaj Brown "who was shot multiple times" was spared in the Philadelphia shootings
Police say a 6-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, marking the second shooting of a 6-year-old in the city this week.
The child's grandparents identified the kid getting shot to CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
They said that Brown's groin, legs, arms, abdomen and many other parts were wounded by gunshots, but the child is sober on the way to hospital.
"He suffered a lot, his little body was riddled with bullets," his grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the station.
I can't believe it.
The boy is in a very critical condition at the hospital and has undergone several surgeries.
Family tells the station that the child is expected to recover.
He planed  to  enter first grade in a local elementary school in the first place.
Brown is one of four people who were shot in the Germantown area.
Of the other three people who got shoot, two are  29 years old and one is 32 years old.
According to CBS Philadelphia, one of the 29-year-old victims was in critical condition; the other two were in stable condition.
The TV station reported that the child  and the 29-year-old victim who is in an emergency were found in the car's front seat.
The other two victims were not in the car, the police are investigating whether the gunman is among the injured.
Investigators told CBS Philadelphia that it looked like a crossfire from many gunmen.
The scene found a lot of offensive weapon shells, which can be inferred that they used different offensive weapons.
It is judged that this is undoubtedly a continuing war.
There are bullets shells on the sidewalk on both sides of the street.
"So it appears that there were multiple armed combatants out here and that they were actively engaged,”  Philadelphia police Captain Anthony Ginaldi told the TV station.
Many houses and vehicles in the area were damaged.
The arresting operation has not been launched. It is said that the police are watching the surveillance video.
On Tuesday, a six-year-old kid, a girl, was shot in the arm while playing in front of her home in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
Presently she is recovering,  and the police are still in pursuit of the suspects.
Why we need Simon, Gabrielle and Laurie
That is how I comment on the Olympic women's gymnastics team for this year with more than one reason.
First of all, from 1984 onwards, I went to every summer Olympic Game, but the United States has never occupied such a dominant position.
Secondly,  this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren Laurie Hernandez, who have been inspiring so many colored young girls.
The make-up of this team, rounded out by Aly Raisman, who is Jewish, and Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, is making everyone proud.
This team finally looks like the U.S. team.
It has also reinforced the top rankings of Black and Latina female in this sport.
Over the past four years, the leading female gymnast has been African-American.
Last year, Simon and Gabriel were ranked the first and second.
This is awesome.
The last Olympic Games, Gabriel Leo Douglas "unexpectedly" got a Olympic championship, which makes the United States cheered endlessly.
Now the whole world is able to witness the incredible performances of three-time World Champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez. They made the traditional gymnastics skills extremely miraculous.
On Thursday, Simone helped the US team win 4th straight in the women's individual all-around event.
Her teammate Aly Raisman won a silver medal.
We are witnessing the top of the sport, but it does not look like this at gymnastics classes across the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all took the same path as Aly and Madison to make the Olympic team.
They are called "Final Five", because the next Olympic gymnastics team will be composed of four gymnasts, and this will be Marta Karolyi's last year as a coach .
But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnasts primarily train in private gymnastics clubs. Their parents have to pay the cost of the training, facility, travel, uniforms, competition fees, hotel fees (for the coaches, gymnasts and their families) and the list goes on.
Most of these gymnastics clubs are located in affluent suburban neighborhoods that can support the business.
These clubs are where the gymnasts get all of their training, and it's a costly and long-term commitment for the gymnasts' families.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both coached their athletes since they started in gymnastics.
We must bring more affordable and accessible gymnastics to countless young girls who are deeply influenced by Simon, Gabriel and Laurie.
20 years ago, I set up my own gymnastics foundation.
In my organization, we offer free, cheap gymnastics to more than 15,000 urban youth (mainly black and Hispanic Americans) in black residential areas and train national and world champions.
In September, we will expand the program to Detroit, which is my hometown, to provide high quality gymnastics to young people who deserve this opportunity to learn and to benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics not only contributes to developing your body's strength, flexibility and coordination, but also facilitates to cultivate your hard-working spirit, self-discipline and determination.
This can bring lifelong benefits to a person's health, school and work success.
Encouraged by this team, thousands of young girls will learn gymnastics, which is really great.
Exercising is very important, especially for girls.
This is an exciting moment.
Thanks to Simon, Ali, Laurie, Gabrielle and Madison for displaying "girl power" in the process of winning the Olympic gold medal, but also thank them for inspiring young girls from different backgrounds to walk upon a healthy, strong, and successful road.
After dismissing Jeremy Hunt's proposal, the junior doctor plans to launch a further strike
The ministers initially wanted to end the change-induced dispute by accepting a revised contract from the British Medical Association (BMA), but 58 percent of the 37,000 primary doctors who participated in the vote were opposed to the contract.
In July, Mr. Hunter revealed plans to impose the contract, saying the British National Health Service System (NHS) is currently undergoing a vacuum of leadership, and any slight delay damages the interests of both employees and patients.
The new contract first mentions the revision of the junior doctors' overnight and weekend work practices in order to improve the caring of non-normal working hours.
Last night, Dr. Ellen McCourt, chairman of the BMA Junior Medical Council, said in a statement: "The junior doctor is still seriously concerned about the proposed contract, especially worried that it will exacerbate the current labor crisis and fail to treat all doctors fairly."
With just eight weeks before the first group of doctors are moved onto the new contract, progress needs to be made and time is running out.
BMA tried to resolve the dispute through negotiations, but was faced with other parties' reluctance to participate, and silence from the government sometimes.
Even so, just last month we got Jeremy Hunt's promise that his main door was always open.
"Now it is time for Jeremy Hunt to take action, revoke the imposition,  and settle the problem that junior doctors concern about."
If he does not do so, the doctors made it clear that they are ready to take further labor action.
The last strike took place at the end of April, resulting in the cancellation of nearly 13,000 routine operation and 100,000 appointments due to the redeployment of nurses and consultation doctors for the doctors on the picket line.
At first, ministers wanted to close this dispute caused by a change, through accepting the contract revised by the BMA.
BMA hopes to get better weekend salary for the 54,000 junior doctors involved in the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, chief executive officer of NHS Employers, asked the  junior doctors not to call any further strike.
“The labor force has little effect, on the contrary, it put pressure on the already dedicated team and service, leading to concerns, worries and confusion among patients, caregivers and their families, " Mr. Mortimer said."
Over the past two months, we have been negotiating with the Junior Medical Council and actively with the Ministry of Health and other departments to respond to their concerns about the role of guardians and reports.
Employers hoped that continued active discussions on other important topics - such as deployment, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from  a career break, training costs, mutual recognition of  curriculum syllabus, study leave and gender pay gap in medical field, were an indication that employers, the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health were very serious on the agreements reached with BMA in November, February and May.
A £ 2 medication per day can reduce the risk of heart attack
Relevant officials suggested promotion of a kind of drug worthing 2 dollars to more patients and extension of medication time, after which thousands of heart disease patients would benefit from this drug.
Antithrombotic ticagrelor can reduce the risk of heart disease recurrence in patients with heart disease.
Taking this medication for 12 months after a heart attack can reduce the risk of stroke or another heart attack.
The National Institutes of Health and Clinical Optimization (NICE) advises patients to stay on medication for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.
But now, NHS inspection agency NICE recommends patience keep taking this medicine for four years in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.
In England, about 140,000 people  suffer from heart disease each year, and a quarter of them run into a recurrence of the heart disease or a stroke.
Heart attack and stroke are caused by the formation of plaque in the arterial wall.
If the plaque is broken, it will lead to thrombosis and thus impede flow of blood into the heart, leading to heart attack.
If the thrombus moves, it will enter the bloodstream and hinder blood from flowing into the brain, leading to a stroke.
Those who have experienced a heart attack have a higher risk that heart attack happens again.
Tekagrad was manufactured by British company AstraZeneca, sold under the trade name Brilique, and reduces the risk of thrombosis by reducing thrombus formation.
The draft NICE guidance, published today, recommends that patient be given 90mg of Ticagrelor for 12 months, followed by 60mg along with aspirin twice a day for another three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director at the NICE health technology evaluation center, said: "Despite the availability of effective secondary prevention treatments, as many as a quarter of people who have had a heart attack go on to have another heart attack or stroke, often with devastating consequences.""
Fear of recurrence was negatively related to quality of a person's life.
Evidence suggests that taking ticagrel alongside with aspirin can reduce the risk of heart disease recurrence and stroke in those who have undergone heart attacks.
We are very pleased that Tempel's provisional recommendation will provide more treatment options for thousands of people who will benefit from it.
Due to limited information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor beyond three years, particularly the risk of bleeding,  the draft guideline does not recommend continued treatment with it beyond that period.
Computer culture makes "voting fraud" prevailing in Muslim communities
Ex-Tower Hamlets mayor Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year after being found of guilty of corruption, motivating the issue of a government report.
The "political correctness" culture has led to widespread electoral fraud in the Muslim community, which has been revealed today by the report of the government.
Former Cabinet Minister Sir Eric Pickles accused the police, the Electoral Commission and the City Hall of turning a blind eye to the evidence of corrupt electoral practices because of "over-sensitivity about ethnicity and religion".
The former communities secretary, now the anti-corruption tsar, said the intimidation of voters on religious grounds was so bad that police should be allowed to put cordons outside polling stations to protect frightened voters.
He suggested that the voters should carry their identity documents in order to verify their identities.
At present, voters only need to report their name and address.
The report even suggested that ink that cannot be erased be painted on the finger of each voter, to prevent someone from voting twice.
Sir Eric said that the protection efforts on whistle blowers should be increased.
He calls for the media to be given greater access to council papers and decisions made by unofficial committees or working groups.
"This is not just to prevent election fraud but also to protect the local government from widespread corruption culture and the financial fraud that is closely linked to it”,  he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street in the wake of the Tower Hamlets voting scandal in East London.
Last year, a special electoral court ruled that there was a series of corrupt and illegal acts in Mayor Rahman, who should be dismissed.
The court found that Rahman ‘cynically perverted’ the religious feeling of his Muslim community in the area and silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman, it was said, 'ran his campaign on the basis that it was the religious duty of faithful Muslims to vote for him'. "
As many as 300 votes is in question, it is likely caused by voters counterfeited others and casted their votes.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of voter fraud across the country.
He voiced particular alarm about postal voting fraud, in which senior members of the Muslim community were said to have exerted pressure on people to vote for a candidate of their choosing.
Sir Eric (in photo) made a good deal of suggestions on how to clean up the voting mechanism,  which includes bringing valid identity document to confirm identity.
His report says: "Evidence suggested that pressure was being put on vulnerable members of some ethnic minority communities, particularly women and young people, to vote according to the will of the elders, especially in communities of Pakistani and Bangladeshi background.""
"Because of the over-sensitivity to the 'political correctness' of racial and religious harmony, they fear that national institutions will turn a blind eye to such behavior."
Sir Eric presented 50 proposals to clean up the electoral system, including the prohibition of political activists in handling mailing papers to prevent "voting gains".
The report also requires thorough investigation of registration information to prevent voter lists from being used for immigration and welfare fraud.Theresa May is also considering the report.
These proposals include requiring voters to present their proof of identity before casting a ballot.
After the voter has voted, his or her  finger is painted with ink that can not be wiped to prevent someone from voting twice.
Carry out systematic checks on a person's nationality to ensure they are eligible to vote.
The validity period for postal voting request is set to be three years.
Ban political campaigners and activists from handling completed postal votes and postal vote envelopes.
The police has been authorized to cordon off the polling stations.
The amended legal provisions make it easier to sue someone under the "Representation of the People Act 1983".
Make it illegal to take pictures in polling stations.
Make it a requirement that only English is to be used in polling stations (except in Wales).
Strengthen training to ensure staff enforce the rule that "voters go to the booth alone".
Sir Eric denounced the Metropolitan Police, saying that they did not raise any charges of allegations after the Tower Hamlets incident, which was "surprising".
“Rahman and his electoral officers have committed a lot of corruption and illegal acts and have been disqualified by the electoral tribunal, " he said.
In accordance with the standard of criminal certification, he is undoubtedly guilty in many aspects.
He also criticizes the ineffectual 'tick-box inspections' of the voter registrar's office in city hall.
Sir Eric said: "Last year the court's decision on Tower Hamlets sounded the alarm for everyone."
Our country has a glorious tradition of "the mother of parliament", but some institutions' sneaky election fraud and the subsequent denial is really worrying and threatening this good reputation.
At the Rio Olympic Games, athletes that look like celebrities such as the biker who resembles Princess Kate are sought after
Fans of the Rio 2016 Olympics this week have gone wild for French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has proven an impressive lookalike for the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympian is far from being the only athlete out fighting for gold this summer that boasts a striking resemblance to a celebrity - at least not according to social media.
So, to commemorate the Rio Olympic Games and all the celebrities appeared on the screen, FEMAIL sorted out a list of Olympic players who look like Hollywood celebrities.
The hunter and the wolf: US Men's Archery Team member Brady Ellison (left), has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child
Besides Kate's doppelganger on the cycling track, many people online have been quick to point out how a certain archer could be the twin of A-lister Leonardo DiCaprio.
Since his resemblance to the Wolf of Wall Street star got exposed on Twitter, American men's archery team member Brady Ellison caused a huge stir in social media.
In fact, the archery player was aware of the social media speculation and admit that people have been saying that he looks like Leonardo DiCaprio.
"I think besides the beard, it doesn't look the same," Brady said to the Huffington Post.
"He is a handsome playboy, so I think this is a compliment to me"
One of the most popular comparisons at the 2012 London Olympic Games this year will undoubtedly have more similarities to be discovered: British long jumper Greg Rutherford (Greg Rutherford) looks a very famous actor Neil Patrick Harris (Neil Patrick Harris).
Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina, with her large, expressive eyes, has been said to be a dead ringer for Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
In the swimming arena, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has always been compared with Matthew Morrison, who starred in Glee.
Changing it up: This user reckons that Nathan is an 'athletic version' of the Inception actor
Another long-running comparison has been between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett who boast a very similar heavy brow and lips.
Silver medal swimmer Russia's Yulia Efimova boasts more than just the same sunkissed skin and blond hair as actress Annalynne McCord, while Team USA's Nathan Adrian has been said by fans to resemble an 'athletic version of Joseph Gorgon Levitt.'
Tomboy: soccer star Hope Solo (left) and "Dexter" star Jennifer Carpenter (right) bear a similar face and eyes
Not the only one: a Twitter user was happy that others also noticed the resemblance.
Diffusion theory: According to this certain user, there may be a reason why the pair resemble each other.
One Twitter user took to the site recently to declare her happiness that "the rest of the Internet users think that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical.""
Indeed, the American football star and the actor who starred in "Dexter" have a very high similarity on the facial form and eyes.
Other popular contrasts include Kerri Walsh Jennings, whose smile is almost exactly the same as the actress Laura Linney; and the gold medalist, Gabby Douglas, her beautiful and splendid smile is exactly the same as the smile of the Bring It On star Gabrielle Union.
The CBC Olympic commentator apologized for commenting Chinese swimmers as "slow as a pig".
Byron MacDonald’s comments of 14-year-old Yanhan Ai who finished fourth place at the women’s 4x200m freestyle relay has outraged viewers of CBC’s live Olympic coverage on Wednesday.
Canadian broadcaster CBC has been forced to apologize after one of its commentators said a 14-year-old female Chinese swimmer 'went out like stink' and 'died like a pig' during a race.
Thinking his mic was off, commentator Byron MacDonald started to dispense some of his opinions at the end of the women's 4x200m freestyle relay final.
CBC commentator Byron was heard saying in a biased tone: 'That little 14-year-old from Chinese girl dropped the ball."
Too excited, went out like stink, died like a pig
Really thanks to her.
The 14-year-old Chinese swimmer, Ai Yan, who swam the second leg of the relay, used 1 minute 57 seconds 79 - lagging behind Taylor Ruck in Canada for 1.61 seconds, allowing the Canadian team to narrow the gap with China.
Viewers across Canada were quick to react on-line after being shocked by the tone and the language used by the commentator.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: "The CBC commentator says China's 14-year-old swimmer 'is as slow as a pig'??? "
The idiot did not realize he was on the air.
Yanhan Ai, the young Chinese swimmer in the Women's 4x200 Freestyle Relay Final, was depicted as, "That 14-year-old girl from China dropped the ball." "
Twitter's criticism of Byron MacDonald was overwhelmingly high on Twitter, and many asked to him to withdraw from it and explain.
When Twitter users heard that Byron MacDonald was unresponsive on the issue, they did not stop there.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: "Wow # Byron Macdonald.
You represent CBC and Canada, and your words and deeds make us all look like a group of racists.# Really annoying.
Soon after, Scott Russel, the broadcaster of BBC, apologized on-air for MacDonald's comment, saying: 'We apologize for the on-air comment made on a swimming performance. "
We're sorry for unfortunate choice of words. "
CBC apologized more than 90 times to Twitter users who responded to this comment.
Another commentator, Scott Russel, also apologized on behalf of Byron
CBC then copied and pasted their apology to more than 90 other Twitter users who complained about Byron's comments.
The network soon made an apology and released a statement.
We're very  sorry for broadcasting the choice of words.
Last night, we took action quickly to apologize to our viewers who watched our live and to people who subscribed on social media.
To be clear, Byron's comments were related to the swimmer's performance, not to her as an individual.
That is, the wording is really inappropriate, Byron was deeply sorry about this.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized on live radio, saying that his words did not mean to personally attack anyone in the slightest, and tried to excuse himself from his words.
'I would like to take a moment to apologize for a comment that I made last night after the women's relay,' he said on CBC's Olympic broadcast.
"I just commented on the performance of the swimmer, not against his individual."
"Of course, I have no intention of any disrespect, I am sorry."
Primark shopper was outraged at a woman who brazenly tried on underwear in the middle of the shop.
A woman took off her clothes to try on underwear in the middle of a Primark shop, customers in the store did not know where to look.
Even worse, she also looked at how she looked after wearing it, and then took off the underwear and put it back on the shelf.
She continued browsing and eventually tried on four pairs of underwear at the store in Bouverie Place shopping center, Folkestone.
The woman is constantly trying on underwears and putting them back in the shelves at the Primark store located at Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkestone.
A mother-of-two, Jenny Davidson, who was in the shop at the time, said that the mystery woman "got dressed again and walked out of the store without buying anything" after she tried on the underwear. "
She said: "No one could believe what they saw."
She just stood in the center of the shop, took a panty from the shelves, took off  her legging  and underwear, and then put on the new one.
"She did not try to find a secluded area to try on the clothes - she just stood there, which is really brazen of her."
"When she took off her underwear again, everyone was stunned.Obviously, she was still not satisfied as she put the underwear back on the shelf."
After that, she did the same with three more pairs before finally deciding there was nothing she liked and she got dressed again and walked out.
'She didn't seem to care who was watching - or think about the person who would eventually buy the knickers she'd been trying on.'“
Ms Davidson, 33, who lives in the Kent town, said: 'How disgusting to think someone is going to take home knickers that another person has been wearing and they haven't been cleaned.'"
This incident happened on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms Davidson added: "the staff apparently tried to remove the garments from sale after she had left, which is just as well."
"I hate getting a new underwear but  later finding out at home that it had been tried on by another woman and had not been washed."
A Primark spokesman said: "Primark has already known what happened in our Folkestone store on August 9th (Tuesday)."
All items in question have been pulled from shelves.
How to use krev Maga to protect yourself in a gun attack.
This world is very dangerous, but these videos on Dailymail.com may give you a little sense of security.
We sought advice from Rhon Mizrachi, New York-based grandmaster of the Krav Maga Federation, to find out how to deal with gun-toting muggers at close range.
Whether he approaches you from the front or behind, this video will teach you how to turn the tables.
If the gunman approached you from behind,  the first thing to do is turn around, so that you can see your attacker and 'clear the line of fire', Mizrachi says.
Then, grip the gun with your forearm and shoulder, and then use your elbow to hit the attacker's face.
A knee to the groin follows, and while the attacker doubles up in pain, you twist the gun from his hands, smack him in the face with the barrel and back up, keeping the weapon trained on him.
For gunmen approaching from the front, it's a similar technique. Get your body out of the line of fire, grab the gun and twist it around so the villain can't fire.
At the same time,  put weight on the gun and hit the attacker's chest, then twist the gun from his grip and point the muzzle at him.
It sounds complicated?
Check the video and see how Mizrachi did it.
But keep in mind that if you are not a master of Maga, the safest way to get rid of robbery is to hand over cash.
Family of yobs destroyed Saltash, Cornwall council house ahead of being evicted.
A family of rogues left their council house with £50,000 worth of damage after they were evicted for terrorizing their neighbors.
After a long list of complaints, Tanya Skeldon and her husband Shaun Trebilcock were driven out of the low-rent housing in Soltas, Cornwall.
After being forced to leave the residence, the Housing Association officials were surprised to find that the place had been severely ruined.
The walls were full of holes, the floor was torn, garbage was here and there,  and there were scribbles  all over the walls.
The family has been changing their residence after they were expelled, and it's said that they live in a private house now.
Donna McEvoy, housing manager at Cornwall Housing, said she feared it might be beyond saving.
She said: "For those who are living here, it's a nightmare. I do not think people should have to live in this way."
There are a lot of things to be weighed up because the house is likely to become not  so good an element in Cornwall.
This family is notorious and their names are also notorious.
The couple have three sons, and they will stay here from time to time.The police say the reign of terror the family inflicted included fighting in the street with baseball bats, intimidating nearby residents, drug use, drug dealing and excessive shouting, arguing and swearing.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the tenancy, was given an antisocial behaviour order in June.
Old rubbish was found in a number of the rooms of the house, which may be demolished.
Floor boards had been pulled up in the property, from which drugs had been dealt in the past
Neighbors said that they often saw them fighting on the streets, and often reported to the police regarding it.
The Cornwall Housing Association evicted her and her husband this week after giving them an 11-week extension for voluntary move out.
The relieved neighbors cheered, saying that they were like living in hell before.
A neighbor said: "They do not care about anyone."
We stayed for 20 years in their next door, and it has been so bad.
We have seen the police at the place countless times.
"This morning, we could not sleep.""
We got up really early, because it was too quiet here - we're still not used to it!
They are finally gone, which is really good.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Cornwall Housing's neighbourhood enforcement manager, said the family failed to cooperate with the local authority.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, and the police often visited
Garbage and old toys are thrown aside in the weeds of the low-rent housing
He added: "Unfortunately, the tenant did not take any responsibility for her behaviors and her family's, and the expulsion was the final decision of the Cornwall Housing Association."
This is a very difficult case to deal with because their behaviors were very extreme, and their actions must have been very terrifying to their neighbors.
I would like to thank my team for their work, my thanks also go to Devon and Cornwall Police and to those brave community members who provide information to us.
I hope that this move will give some comfort to the neighbors and sends out a message that antisocial behavior will not be tolerated.
Mr. Fitzpatrick said that their three boys had lived in this house at different times, but said they were only in their 20s at that time.
A dirty mattress left on the floor of one of the bedrooms in the house after they were evicted.
Housing Association workers will soon clean up the rubbish around the house
In 2014, the police raided the house and discovered more than 70 grams of marijuana. They also found a balance, drug paraphernalia, and £ 1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined after pleading guilty to possession of a Class B drug with intent to supply.
She claimed the money was going towards a headstone for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car crash in 2013.
After being made homeless, it is understood that Tanya and her partner are now living in private housing in Plymouth.
Graffiti was scrawled across walls of many rooms in this property.
The police said they would evict tenants who defied the tenants' rules.
Angela Crow, of Devon and Cornwall Police, said the eviction sent a clear warning to other tenants who continue to flout the rules.
"This warning is aimed at those who think that their behavior will not be accused, and those who suffer from this behavior, " she said.
Devon County and Cornwall Police will never tolerate crime and antisocial behaviors, and they will continue to work together to protect our communities.
Reed: if Hillary was elected as president she would nominate Garland as Supreme Court judge.
Senate Democrat Harry Reid said he was convinced that if Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton was elected president, she would nominate Judge Garrick to join the Supreme Court.
Senator Republicans have been preventing the confirmation Barnard's nomination of Garland since March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the next president would appoint this person to succeed the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
At a conference call on Thursday, Reed said he predicted that Hillary would have chosen Garland, who  has "some credibility".
A spokeswoman for Reed then said that Reed was not going to nominate Garland to speak directly with Hillary, and said he was just guessing.
He praised Garland and said Hillary’s team would not want to “rock the boat” with a new candidate.
Garland is the chief judge of the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia.
Reid said that the Republicans who had been prevented from Garland's nomination were Donald Trump, the Republican presidential candidate, and "Achievement".
He said Trump was not suitable to be president.
"Treats": nude calendar "both men and women love"
"Treats" magazine together with photographer David Bellemere, will shoot for a 2017 photographic calendar, with inspiration from the classic Pirelli calendar of 1970's.
This time, they are planning to find a new generation of top models for their 2017 NU Muses calendar instead of famous naked people.
Steve Shaw, president of Treats, said earlier this year that their nude-heavy magazine was different from the old-fashioned Playboy because "the latter was for men."
And we are targeting at women.
Obviously, he thinks this group of calendars is the same.
"We need to get back to showcasing timeless and classic nudity where both women and men feel comfortable and inspired by these images, " Shaw said in a press release announcing the calendar.
Women will be happy to participate in this shooting activity because it is a beautiful artwork.
Models can submit online applications, but also personally go to Los Angeles and New York's open recruitment site candidates.
Video report shows: The Greenland shark is the longest living vertebrate

Julius Nielsen, who has been studying sharks, says that according to the records, a female sleeper shark is between 272 and 512 years old,  and is five meters long.
The French court dismissed the petition to dismantle the shop in the jungle refugee camp
A French court dismissed the petition of the Calais government on dismantling dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the "jungle" camp.The refugee camp currently houses thousands of refugees.
At a court hearing this week, Calais authorities had argued the state should be able to knock down a total of 72 makeshift shops.People sell goods  in shops in the camp, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts, or sell tea for 50 cents (40p) or basic meals for a few euros in makeshift restaurants.
The Calais prefect’s office argued the places should be demolished because they represented a parallel economy that didn't pay tax and they carried fire and sanitation risks.
Humanitarian groups expressed the importance of these shops and restaurants to the court, this is because the free food provided by state-supported associations and other groups simply cannot meet the growing needs of refugee camps.
They said the makeshift shops and restaurants often provided shelter and free meals to those in need.
A Lille court ruled there was no legal basis for expelling the people running the 72 makeshift shops, but said the Calais prefect’s concerns “were totally understandable”.
The judge, Jean-François Molla, said the groceries, cafes and restaurants played a much bigger role than simply feeding people that “live in extremely precarious conditions”.
He said that these places are a peaceful place of meeting for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places that had been under threat from demolition was the camp’s "Jungle Book Kids’ Cafe" which is run not-for-profit and provides 200 meals a day, English and French classes, and asylum advice for the hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people signed a petition to preserve this cafe.
One of the letters to Guardian mentioned that the closure of the cafe would be a catastrophe for these children (many of whom are only eight years old)."
Two charitable organizations, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that the number of refugees in the jungle refugee camp has exceeded 9000, which is the highest level since the surge in the number.
The British team took the silver medal in the 7-man Rugby game and the Fiji team won the gold medal
In the seven-man rugby final on Thursday evening, the British team failed to continue to perform well in front of the Fiji team, and was defeated by the Fiji team with a score of 43 to 7 at Rio Teodoro Stadium.
Fiji won the gold medal through controlling the ball, steals, avoidance, cooperation, running and strength, which is the first ever Olympic medal in the country's history.
For the British team defeated by their opponents, a silver medal was also a small comfort, that was the third silver medal won by the British team on the same day.GB rugby team  could be proud of their efforts in the inaugural Olympic 7s tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa along the way.
Earlier in the day, the British team narrowly won the South African team with a score of 7-5, which could have affected their performance in the finals.
But in any case, the current Fiji team is enough to beat a full 15 person team.
Tomorrow, at least one of the British will win a gold medal, which may be a comfort to the British team, or may be not.The British is Ben Ryan, Fiji's chief coach for Wimbledon, who used to serve as the British team's chief coach.
It is not easy for the British team to achieve today's results.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens
And now, they are only one step away from the championship.
Although there has been a huge blow, the progress has been amazing.
Fiji team gained ground at the beginning, making the British team can not fight back at all.
For Tom Mitchell and his teammates, this is like running up against a line of moving buses.When Ochen Collinsso charged into the flag area, the world championship team is already 5 to 0 in the lead.
Only four minutes after the game began, Jerry Tuohua touched down in the right wing again.
12 to 0, and British team almost did not hit the ball.
Mitchell's strong  tackle stopped a third goal attempt by the mountain-like Leone Nakarawa, but that was merely a slight delay in Fiji's winning.
On seven minutes, Jasa Veremalua touched down in the right corner. 17 to 0, the British team's situation worsens.
Nakarawa scores another point, and there is still one minute left ... in the first half of the game.
Then, Wattmo Lavo broke the British defense, went straight to scoring line.
At the half-time break, the score was already 29 to 0.
Fijians people seem to be born to play Rugby sevens and the British team is still fledgling.
This is the case.
Team GB made a huge change in the second half and attacked the defense of Fiji team for four whole minutes. They played some good stuff  for the first half.But the Fiji team has played a wonderful game after, and scored again by Joshua Tuasulia.
Dan Norton grabbed a try for GB, touching down in the left corner to make it 36-7 but the game was long gone the way of the South Sea Islanders whose fans sang, waved flags and danced in the stands.
Fiji's wonderful performance has to be applauded.
Martha William at the last minute defended the Fiji team's indifferent attack.
The final whistle sounded, the Fijians embraced, and the defeated British team could only regretfully exit.
Earlier in the day, Fiji defeated the Japanese team in the semifinals by 20 to 5, while the British won against the South African team in a fierce semi-final match.
Kyle Brown helped the South African team gain the lead in the first half, but Dan Norton scored in the second half with his excellent footwork.
After the England team's member Anthony's brother Marcus Watson ensured the team's victory with a wonderful interception, the British team eventually won the silver medal.
Being inspired by their cancer-stricken coach, Helen Graf and Heather Stanning won the gold medal in the women's pair.
It's not an exaggeration to say that this is the most touching gold medal.
From the first stroke to the last, 220 punishing heaves, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning  added remarkable meaning in their gold medal at Estacio da Lagoa.
Although there were only two of them rowing, there was another voice in that boat, the voice of coach Robin Williams ever accompanied them as they charged to a second Olympic gold in the women’s pairs, the first female duo in the history of British sport to reach such a height.
They have maintained a 39 unbeaten record, with an absolute advantage.
What we're seeing is that these two talented athletes are gracefully moving forward on the water, however it does not represent the whole of this victory.
Behind each row of gold medals there are many people who volunteer to help, it is their constant dedication that creates a difference, and the biggest help is no other than the coach who found out 30 months ago that he has cancer, and does not know whether he will live to see the day his charges succeed.
Just as he said, death may come at any time.
I got bladder cancer and they performed surgery on me.
If you choose to go without surgery, cancer cells will spread around the entire body.
In this way, the situation will be much worse.
This will change your opinion slightly.
Williams was diagnosed with cancer in December 2013.
Fortunately, he received treatment in early 2014 and minimized the impact of the sickness, although it may inappropriate to say that in this circumstance.
I need to get my paycheck, so I must get better ASAP.
It is an encouragement for me.
I stay in the hospital. Although they say a few steps will do,  I still walk around the ward for 20 feet, 30 feet, even 50 feet every time.
This is the starting point for everything.
The rowing exercise itself is a journey, which makes this journey a little longer.
At the moment of winning the gold medal, the person who they first had in mind was Williams.This morning, Williams was slightly more talkative than usual, in order to overcome his anxiety.
Stanning, the hence-Captain of the Royal Artillery,  will leave for Afghanistan shortly.  She said: "I had been in a very bad mood this week, may be a bit unusual, but this gold medal in deed means so much to me."
It tells me over and over how important this is for me, and how much effort Helen, Robin and I have made for this.
This is the result that Helen, Robin and I worked hard for in the last three years.
Without Robin, we would just be nobody. We  appreciate him very much, and he is the best coach in the world.
I can not find a better trainer and coach than him.
Helen Graff and Heather Steinning have not lost in five years.
The punishment intensity caused by the combination is something their opponents can not match with.
Even at the last 500 meters,  when rivals from New Zealand and Denmark began to catch up, Stanning  and Glover still had a lot of physical reserves.
It was thrilling at the time.
Helen shouted: "keep the rhythm, keep the rhythm."
Not being affected by the opponent is indeed very important.
We have a good start, and we are not looking forward to doing anything earth-shattering.
We did not think about the glory of today, we just wanted to draw every paddle and win the game, and we did it.
This combination took a year to decide their own future.
Glover will marry to TV adventurer Steve Backshall next month.
But now, she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't want to say that this was my last game.
That will put two much pressure on me.
In London, it took me about six months to realize that I was an Olympic champion.
This is a whole new experience, and I feel very nervous.
Now, about four minutes has passed.
She said, "I feel much better."

Snapchat ‘Anime’ Effect Is Criticized as Asian Caricature
Snapchat says this filter is inspired by anime, but some observers say it’s racially insensitive.
Snapchat's 150 million day-to-day users can change reality through their filter tools and make their faces funny.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a character in a Roy Lichtenstein movie.
These lenses have the effect of blurring the edges, and bending characteristics, resulting in more than 30 million modified selfies.
Any mistakes will be immediately noticed by the public.
Snapchat filters have been criticized, the application is accused of promoting the idea that black or white skin is beautiful.
Thus, when the application provided some users with a filter that could create oblique, dull, and pink face effects, some critics saw it as a racial slur to the Asian "yellow" races.
They even think that if the recurring problems mean that the company has a bigger problem in diversity.
The outrage went wide on Wednesday, with reports by The Verge and Motherboard, after Snapchat said it had dismantled the feature.
The company's explanation is that it is a tribute to anime characters and not meant to mock Asians.
But for observers who have experienced racism, the lens reminded them of hurtful stereotypes in action.
Other people are also firmly opposed to these cartoon images.
In an email,  a Korean American art student whose tweet about the photos was widely shared said that the lens was “hurtful and uncomfortable to say the least.”
She also said: "It is difficult to distinguish between the extremely disgusting Asian satire and the effect of the filter."
Although the filter does not just have Asians (people with yellow skin), but they are extremely belittled.
Snapchat is not the only company that touches these cultural bottom lines.
From the company's board of directors to Hollywood and the equipment we carry, American culture seems to have been promoting diversity and inclusiveness.
The huge population of younger generation in Snapchat pays more attention to the diversity of races than the older one, so they may likely to be more sensitive about it.
When a filter in Snapchat produced an image insulting its user, 25-year-old Zhu Kaidi in an interview on Thursday said: "Compared to the past, this sort of things is more difficult to escape from our eyes."
On Thursday, Ms. Zhu, a product manager and engineer who works for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and encouraged others to do the same.
In an essay for Medium and in a telephone interview, she said she believed that the race-related controversies reflected a lack of diversity in hiring practices at Snapchat.
Ms. Zhu criticized that majority of the company's employees are white and all the leadership are men. She added a tag at the end of the article: #DeleteSnapchat.
“It’s either that they had no diverse representation of people of color on their staff to the point where they’re able to make decisions like this, ” Ms. Zhu, who is Chinese-American, said, “or they do have some people of color who are working there, but they’re not on positions where they feel safe or comfortable to speak up.”"
Other observers shared that she had complained about the lack of reply from Snapchat.
The company has not released any data on employee diversity, claiming that it is a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the racial background of its employees. However, a spokesman said that the company had recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented  groups and to promote  inclusiveness.
Ms. Zhu said she would deactivate her Snapchat account, adding, “I wonder if they actually need more users like us to be able to say that this is not O.K.”"
The Congress Committee said that the military officials distorted the intelligence of ISIS.
Officials from the United States Central Command altered intelligence reports to portray a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than actual events on the ground warranted, a congressional panel said in a report issued on Thursday.
The interim report, from a task force established by the Republican chairmen of the House Armed Services Committee, Intelligence Committee and Defense Appropriations Subcommittee.The  report found “widespread dissatisfaction” among Central Command intelligence analysts, who said superiors were falsifying their assessments of American efforts to defeat the Islamic State.
The CENTCOM's main headquarters located in Tampa, Florida, is the military headquarters responsible for overseeing US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
According to a report on the news, “the intelligence products approved by senior CENTCOM leaders offers a more positive portrayal about the US anti-terrorism action than the actual situation and are always more positive than the analysis from other intelligence offices."
Representative  of Republican of California said: “ Centcom's behavior is unacceptable."Our war fighters suffer from war when bad analysis is presented to senior policy makers. "
The leadership issue of the Central Command Department has been extended to the top level of the agency.
The report detailed persistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in Central Command’s description and analysis of American efforts to train Iraqi forces.
While there is no definitive evidence that senior officials of the Obama administration have ordered the change of these reports, according to the report's description, these analysts feel that they are under pressure from the Central Command leaders to force them to treat the Islamic countries (ISIS or ISIL) with more optimistic views.
The report said, "in the first half of 2015, many of the Central Command press releases, statements and congressional testimony are much more optimistic than the actual situation."
For example, an official from Central Command publicly stated that it would  undertake a major military operation in April or May 2015 to recover Mosul.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, is still under the control of the Islamic state.
“After months of investigation, the result is very clear,” Representative Mike Pompeo, Republican of Kansas, said in a statement."
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, most of the high-level intelligence officers of the US Central Command manipulated the intelligence and concealed the threat from the Islamic state of Iraq.
Republicans created the task force after learning that analysts had raised concerns that intelligence about the Islamic State was being manipulated.
As the investigation goes forward, more discoveries will emerge in the wake of the report released on Thursday.
The Inspector General of the Department of Defense is also conducting a long-term thorough investigation into the Central Command.
Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee released their own findings on Thursday that agreed with some of the conclusions of the Republican task force.
Representative Adam B. Schiff, the committee’s top Democrat, said in a statement that Central Command created an overly insular process for producing intelligence assessments on ISIS and Iraqi Peacekeeping Forces between 2014 and 2015.
Mr. Xie said that the process "hindered the release of intelligence", reduced the morale of the analyst and "could not accept different opinions.""
But Mr. Anderson and the Democrats also said they did not find any evidence to prove that the White House tried to put pressure on the Central Command's analysts, making their conclusions be in line with "the presuppositions or political narratives.""
The Beast Daily reported on the preliminary result from the congress' investigation on Tuesday.
Last August, The New York Times reported the existence of the Pentagon inspector general investigation, opened after complaints by Centcom analysts.
Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Defense Department would not comment on the congressional report while the inspector general’s investigation continued.
But he said: "Experts sometimes diverge on the interpretation of complex data, and intelligence agencies and the Department of Defense encourage healthy dialogue on these important national security themes."
The impact of the investigation has gone beyond the question of whether the US-led bombing operation in Iraq and Syria is succeeding or not (a claim made by a growing number of defense officials).
But last year, these claims led the public to question the extent to which President Obama could trust the military operations' assessment of Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas issued by the Central Command.
The critiques on the Islamic State intelligence mirror disputes of more than a decade ago, when a Centcom intelligence analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a research paper saying that the administration of President George W. Bush, over many analysts’ objections, advocated a small force in Iraq and spent little time thinking about what would follow the 2003 invasion.
Mr. Hooker also played a key part in the insurrection over the Islamic intelligence.
Some officials commented last year that the announcement by Mr. Hook's team was quite different from the public statement. Mr. Hook's team concluded that the air strikes targeting at the oil refineries controlled by ISIS did not significantly disrupt the revenue of terrorist organizations because the terrorist organization built makeshift refineries  and continued selling fuel on the black market.
According to <Time magazine>'s report in September, the Central Command did not announce the discovery.
The central commander, Lloyd Austin III, was criticized strongly last year after several lawyers examined the Senate testimony over an overly optimistic assessment of the war.
General Austin retired in April and is currently being replaced by Joseph Walter in his position at the Central Command.
The United States won four times in a row in the women's hockey game, and will compete with the British soon
Katie Bam, who had scored three goals to beat Japan, 6-1, scored the first two goals in the American women hockey team's 3-0 victory over India on Thursday night.
27-year-old Bam impressed people with five goals in two games, but when she was asked if she had ever done that, she said she didn't know.
She said: "I knew nothing about this"."
I'm not the kind of person who  remembers the number of  goals.
What she knows is that the US team has made four straight victories in the Olympic Games so far and will compete with the British team, which has yet to be defeated after winning the Japanese team with a score of 2-0, for first place on Thursday.
Britain and the United States met in the first round of the final competition on Saturday.
Both teams qualify for the quarter-finals, and the game will decide who will appear as the first group.
First-place finisher would be in position to avoid the powerful Netherlands for a little longer.The Netherlands team advances with another first-place finisher.
During Saturday's game, the US team created a miracle with their amazing performance.It should be known that four years ago at the London Olympics, the US team was the last of 12 teams.
Bam was also in the team at that time.
Bam grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, first picked up a field hockey stick when she was 3 (her older twin sisters played the sport at Drexel), and joined the national team when she was 16, becoming the youngest team member ever.
She missed the 2008 Olympic Games because she was not selected for the final list.
In 2012, she and her teammates are looked upon favorably.
In the second year,  British Craig Panam served as chief  coach, and everything began to change.
Bam said: "This is a culturally, mentally and substantially change."
We had not reached the current level at that time in London.
We have made a completely turnaround.
On Thursday night, Bam  opened the scoring in the first half with a backhand shot from close in.
India in the current game has not yet won one victory, but the team showed a staggering tenacious fighting spirit and  maintained the score until the end of the third quarter, then Bum broke out.
She ran with the ball along the left side of the stadium for a long distance, cut into the middle, and pumped the ball into the net; the US team was in the lead with 2 to 0.
Melissa Gonzalez scored the last goal in the middle of the fourth quarter.
The shutout was the first of the tournament for the United States goalkeeper, Jackie Briggs, who had allowed one goal in each of the team’s first three victories.
This time she played extraordinarily.
So is Bam .
Panam said: "We are now in a very good position."But it depends on the result of  the game on Saturday to determine how good it is.
The Poor Food during Depression Period in ‘A Magnificent Meal’.
In March 1933, shortly after ascending to the presidency, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down to lunch in the Oval Office.
As a gastronome, President Roosevelt perfers the foods on Fifth Avenue,  such as pâté de foie gras and Maryland terrapin soup.
His menu that day was more humble: deviled eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and, for dessert, prune pudding.
“It was an act of culinary solidarity with the people who were suffering,” Jane Ziegelman said. "
Her husband, Andrew, added: "This also reflects the American way of eating."
The couples living in the Brooklyn Highlands are food historians.
Mr. Ke's last book, "Chop Suey", is about American Chinese food. And Ms. Siegman tells her story about the lives of slumers in her book "97 Orchard".
Their new, collaborative work, “A Square Meal,” which will be published Tuesday by Harper, is a history of American food in the Great Depression.
Showing some culinary solidarity of their own, they met a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg’s Sandwich Shop.This no-frills lunch counter in the Flatiron district that has been in business since the year of the crash, 1929.
Ms. Ziegelman, 54 years old, ordered a cream cheese and chopped olive sandwich, while Mr. Coe, 57 years old, ordered the turkey, mashed potatoes and vegetable medley.
When the reporter ordered meatloaf, the couple deemed it fitting for a discussion of Depression-era eating.
Ms. Zigman said: "At that time, bread was very popular."
There was peanut loaf, liver loaf and bean loaf.
They are all made with one food ingredient and a topping that you can pour over.
Imagine your dinner is all peanuts.
Mr. Ke made a funny face.
He said: "They must be hurtful, like lead in your stomach."
In the years before the Great Depression, the American Dayton was a buffet, especially in the suburbs.
A group of women cook for male farm workers,  freshly baked pies in all three meals.
During the war, it was the Americans who sent food to the starving Europeans."The feast" records how the country suddenly ceased to be a prosperous place.
“That was a time when food became a unpleasant topic for the American people. ” Mr. Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it."
Equally fraught was the new budget diet: Mystery dishes like loaves and casseroles became staples, the casserole a “wonderful way to repurpose leftovers,” Ms. Ziegelman noted, because cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy coating of sauce.
Fresh fruit is replaced by cheap dried fruit.
Meat, for years the center of the American meal, became a sparingly apportioned luxury.
This strange hodgepodge only consider calories compared to taste. Even in basic common sense cooking, people first consider nutrition.
In researching the book, which includes a variety of  recipes, Ms. Ziegelman prepared a period dish of baked onion stuffed with peanut butter.
Mr. Ke said: "This is not common on the dinner table."
Ms. Zigman said: "This is too strange."
Peanut butter and baked onions are not a good match.
This is the unique point of many family-run restaurants.
Family economists have influenced the country's eating habits, such as Luis Stanley, who was the chef of the Federal Family Economic Council from 1923 to 1943, which is historically unique.
They publish recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, encourage women to "spend wisely" and have the courage to transfer awful food like creamy pasta with carrots into delicious dishes.
"Rich meal" is a rich "historical delicacy".
What is particularly interesting is the government's response to the hungry crowd, such as the "I can't manage other people's affair" attitude from President  Herbert Hoover.
While he publicly praised the simple Iowa farmhouse of his childhood, he dined like the millionaire sophisticate he had become.
Mr. Ke said: "I like to eat European-style Western food, such as fish with cucumber sauce."
He dressed in an evening dress and dined in a gilded restaurant.
He is clearly disengaged of the people.
If not for his wife Eleanor  who encouraged him to set an example on the diet, President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake.
As the book says, the steward employed by Ms. Roosevelt has no interest in the taste, so the food in the White House is not only the most unpalatable food in Washington, but also the food made by worst cook. "
When the United States back to track, many of the cooking method invented during the Great Depression was abandoned.
Ms. Zigman said the legacy is our focus on calories and nutrition,  and the application of science to cooking.
The couple said that when they were writing this book, they gained greater understanding of the eating habits of Ms. Ziegelman’s mother — like how she did not throw food away.
“She had a real fear of food waste,” Mr. Coe said."
Ms. Ziegelman recalled: “She actually got people sick."
For example, there was the "cream puff" incident.
After removing the plate, she and her husband took out a dessert that was prepared at home: it was the fruit pudding that President Roosevelt had eaten at lunch.
“It’s called prune whip, ” Ms. Ziegelman said, "adding that it was a common trick to give modest recipes a snazzy name.
There was no whipped cream, just prunes, a little bit of flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctantly sprays the deep sticky brown paste.
Surprisingly, the taste of this dessert was not bad.
Mr. Ke then had a second spoonful, after that another.
He felt it is an acceptable and affordable dessert, and told his wife, “Some chopped walnuts would help.”"
Gillard recapped attorney's  fee in his  battle with Merck over the patent related to Merck's Hepatitis C drugs.
According to the US District Judge's ruling, Gillette Scientific Inc is entitled to receive legal fees incurring  in defending its hepatitis C patent litigation with drugmaker Merck & Co Inc.
In June, after the United States Judge found that Merck had illegal acts, including perjury and other unethical behavior, Gillette was exempted from paying $200 million in compensation generated by Gilead's best-selling drugs Sofosbuvir and Harvoni  that infringed  Merck's two patents.
In Thursday's lawsuit, US District Judge Beth Labson Freeman said Gilead did not have to bear the costs of the defense.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gillette, the dominator of the next-generation hepatitis C drug market.More than 90 percent of hepatitis patients can expect to be cured of their hepatitis C using Gillette's medicine.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other, both claiming ownership of laboratory work underlying Sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead's medicines.
US-backed troops announced that they had taken back Manbij from ISIS.
U.S.-backed forces have seized full control of the northern Syrian city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last remaining Islamic State fighters left, a spokesman for the troop  said Friday.
Syrian Democrats (SDF) are now raiding the city after the militants left the cuty.
They had freed over 2,000 civilian hostages who had been held by the militants, Sharfan Darwish of the SDF allied Manbij Military Council told Reuters.
He told Reuters: "Manbij  is now under our control, but we are still sweeping the area."
The Clintons' income was 107.5 million US dollars in 2015, while the federal tax they paid accounted for 34.2% of their income.
Hillary Clinton announced her 2105 tax return on Friday, showing that the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband earned USD$10.75 million in 2015 and paid a federal tax rate of 34.2 %.
In 2015, the Clinton couple's charitable donations amount to $1 million, most of which were donated to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton's speech fee reached nearly $5.3 million, while the former Secretary of State, through her book on her experiences in the State Department published by publisher Simon and Schuster, earned $3 million in revenue.
Clinton's running mate, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, and his wife Anne Holden, released 10 years of  tax returns.
Two people paid a federal effective tax rate of 20.3%.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set the standard for financial transparency," Clinton campaign aide Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement."
In stark contrast, Donald Trump is hiding behind fake excuses and backtracking on his previous promises to release his tax returns
Although the law does not require it, but by convention, US presidential candidates should disclose their tax returns.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have cited an audit by the Internal Revenue Service  as a reason he has refused to release his returns.
Clinton campaign assistant Ian Summers said on Twitter that you call the shots, and attached a link to the Democratic candidate's tax return.
On Thursday, Trump's legal counsel, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to release his tax return before the audit was completed.
Critics of Trump, including the 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republicans, said that Trump declining to disclose his tax returns would trigger questions about the net worth of his capital, charitable donations, business transactions and various other relationships, including relations with Russia.
Clinton grabbed the issue and criticized it, he published an online video on Friday, highlighting the high-profile Democrats urged Trump to announce his tax situation.
She put forward the issue in Michigan's economic policy speech on Thursday.
She said to the crowd: "For decades, he has refused to publish his tax return as other presidential candidates."
Politico has reported that Trump paid zero to very little taxes for two years in the 1990s and, on Friday, a New York Times business columnist quoted a number of tax lawyers and accountants saying that could still be the case.
The federal tax has become a major issue in the presidential campaign.
Clinton has endorsed a rule named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett that would ensure those making more than $1 million a year pay a tax rate of at least 30 percent.
President Obama also supports this proposal.
At a Clinton rally last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is based there, challenged Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he was also accepting the IRS audit, what Trump "feared" is not the tax authority, but the voters.
Clinton's campaign group has revealed tax returns from as early as the year 2007.
The federal tax rate for the Clinton couples, currently living in Chappaqua, New York, between 2007 and 2014 was about 32%, and the combined tax rate was about 40.5%.
The Clinton couple's 2015 tax returns show that unlike most Americans, their wage earning is only $ 100.
Their main investment is the low-cost index mutual fund, and the Clinton couple has a dividend and interest income of $ 109,000.

Jewish filmmaker criticized the Berlin hotel telling them to remove the Israeli telephone code according to the "request" of the Arab customer - Reuters News
A French filmmaker of Jewish origin unleashed a media furor after he revealed that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin does not list Israel’s dial code, with employee citing “requests” from Arabic customers.
Claude Landzmann, the filmmaker of the Jewish Holocaust documentary film "Shoah", expressed his disappointment with Hotel Kempinski and issued an open letter in the German FAZ.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the list of dial codes provided by the hotel.
But Israel is not in the list of countries to which guests can called directly from the room.
Did Israel actually disappear in the capital of Germany Berlin in 2016?
Langzmann wrote.
Instead, guests can call Israel via the Kempinski Hotel call center.
In order to seek an explanation, the filmmaker asked the hotel's front desk.
Langzmann said in the letter that the answer he received at the front desk "shocked him".
Hotel staff said that this is "a decision made deliberately by Kempinski hotel management board."
And, for this reason made the filmmakers feel even more angry.
“The majority of our guests are Arabs and they demanded Israel’s code to be deleted.” the employee's remark was quoted by Lanzmann."
South German Daily reported  that the Israeli ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, called this incident "a burning shame".
We were shocked after learning about the incident.
The thing itself is a great shame.
The incident that happened in Germany and in that hotel chain is disgraceful.
This needs no more explanation.
"We hope the hotel will be able to draw the right conclusion,” the official said.
This event has been discussed enthusiastically on the web, and everyone thought it was a scandal.
Some people think that Kempinski Hotel was simply being "groveling"  to meet  Arab customers' demands.
“Shame on you. ” another post stated, pointing out that the hotel, located in the noble Kurfurstendamm street stands near a synagogue.
The hotel itself was quick to brush off any accusations, calling what happened an “oversight” and “apologizing” to Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reports.
<South German Daily> quoted Kempinski's words: "Never issued a direct order to remove Israel from the speed dial list."
The newspaper also indicates that the Israeli code has been added to the list.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets to expel protesting Brazilian students.
Students clashed with police during a protest against government reforms to the public education system in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo  on Thursday.
The Police used tear gas and rubber bullets to expel protesters.
The cause of the incident was that law enforcement officials tried to disperse the students, so the police used rubber bullets and tear gas.
Hundreds of students took part in the march and expressed their dissatisfaction with these programs.
In order to save money, Alckmin, the governor of Sao Paulo state, is planing to close 100 public schools, while 300,000 students will be transfered to other schools.
Some students who attended the protest expressed dissatisfaction with the interim president, Michelle Tommel, through graffiti on the wall.
Just a few days before the recent protest, the protesters marched on the streets to support President Dilma Rousseff, who was impeached by the National Senate.
Scottish cyclist Karl Skinner won the cycling gold medal and then came home with glory.
Scottish cyclist Karl Skinner helped the British trio team win the Olympic golden medal at the Rio velodrome last night, and defended title from the London 2012 Olympics.
The 23-year-old cyclist from Glasgow replaced his Scottish comrade- Sir Chris Hoy - and became the backbone of the team.When young Skinner defeated  favorite New Zealand team and  came back winning high praise, even the legendary cyclist was proud of him.
Four years ago, the British team stunned the world, and Hewe won the fifth out of the six Olympic gold medal achieved in his personal career.
The British team was ranked sixth only in London's World Cycling Championships in London in March.Then, the British team created a greater record.
During the time period from Beijing Olympic Games to the London Olympic Games, the British team's problem was the replacement of the "first lap expert" Jamie Stav.
The team did it when Sinders appeared.
Hoy's retirement also left a blank, but Kian Imadi and Matt Krampton wanted to fill the gap.
After seeing Skinner's potential, the British men's team coaching team insisted on selecting  him into the national team, and Skinner eventually lived up to their expectations.
Skinner's partner was Hinders and Kenny, who won the gold medal four years ago with Hoy.The trio reset the Olympic record in the qualifying event, but the result was broken by New Zealand team in the first round.
These 3 British bicycle racers finally defeated the opponents, winning the gold medal.
Although Hindes was slightly behind, Kenny pushed their team in the lead and Skinner kept the advantage all the way to the end.
Strategic change is the key to this reversal. Sinders chose the larger flywheel, making the speed slower, and this allows Kenny, especially Skinner to keep pace.
Hoye watched the game as a BBC commentator.Skinner, Kenny and Sinders saw him when they were at the podium.
Cyclist Skinner, 23, from Glasgow said: "This makes me feel flattered."
I am just doing my best to make a name for myself.
We created the Olympic record in the final and beat the world champion.
It's unbelievable.
Nothing is better than this victory.
After winning the gold medal with Kenny and Hoya at the London Olympics in 2012, Sinders admitted to deliberately falling on the track due to a poor start.
He later took down the comments, and there was no way for British team's opponents to appeal.
And this victory does not involve any such problems.
Sinders said: "It's like in London,  British flags are all over the platform."
We became a team just three months ago.
We've lost a lot of world championships, so it's amazing to be able to defend the Olympic championship.
This is just one game, one gold medal for the British team, as the winner of seven gold medals out of 10 Olympic cycling events in the Beijing Olympic and London Olympic.
If this symbolizes the progress we have made over the past five months, then we will continue to be successful in the bike hall in the next five days.
It might not be impossible for Kenny to replicate Hoy's feat of winning three Olympic gold medals, considering  his present competitive form,
If that was the case, Kenny, 12 years younger than Hoy and also born on March 23,  will have six gold medals and one silver medal.  (This day seems to be the holy day of the British sports, since Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were also Born on the same day)
This result is flat with Hoye.
Kenny will play a three-day race starting from today.
The 28-year-old Bolton said: "I will focus on this game for the time being.
Team competition is always the best.
You can win the match together with your teammates.
To be frank, winning alone is a bit lonely.
Hindes said: "If he wins another two gold medals, he should be granted a knighthood."
It was the only game with the medal awarded on that day, but GB received other good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull  finished first fast and promoted their team to the 4-man 4 km team pursuit race.
Their score is 351.943.
While the world record time set by the 2012 London Olympic gold medalist is 3:51.659.
The first round and the final (10:42 pm) will be held today, the second day of the game. There is no doubt that Wiggins will be in the center of the public.
Yesterday he had a dispute with the race officials right before the qualification event when being summoned for a height measuring.
In the women's team event that will end tomorrow, Laura Trotter, Joanna Rowsell-Shand, Eleanor Barker and Kate Archibald from Milngavie made the cut with a  new world record of 413.260.
The British team is expected to take the initiative and get a few medals in the Olympic Games, by relying on its own strong bicycle team.
After showing its dominance in the Beijing and London Olympic Games, the British cycling team slighted disappoint the public in the process of going to Rio.
There have been many twists and turns, including the resignation of technical director Sean Sutton on April due to allegations of sexism and bullying, and retirements of legendary figures such as Hoye, Victoria Pendleton, etc.
But the first night game at the cycling stadium definitely proves that the British team will legendarily reach their best in a critical moment.
Portland smelter's future is in doubt with the axing of power contract.
The future of the Portland aluminum smelter in Victoria and the jobs of hundreds of workers  are  in doubt with the power company which supplies the plant disclosing one of the plant's owners is to terminate a supply contract, with all supply contracts expected to be axed.
The move occurred after the Victorian government decided to discontinue the subsidies provided to keep the factories in operation.
This 20-year fixed subsidy will end in November.
Alcoa's Portland plant's 2,000 workers may be facing unemployment.
Once the factory is closed, there may be as many as 2,000 people directly or indirectly unemployed.
And because the plant's electricity consumption accounts for about 10% of total electricity output of Victoria, it may also cause a chain reaction.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Hanrui angle smelter, which led to the closure of Anglesey power plant last year.
Alcoa's Portland smelter is now losing money and risks closure.
The moves follows speculation about the future of the plant for several years now, initially in the wake of the strong Australian dollar and more recently due to the price for the output from the plant.
AGL supplies electricity to this large aluminum smelter plant through Loy Yang Power Station in Latrobe Valley .This company predicts that workers from three other plants will terminate their agreements as well.
The largest shareholder of this plant is a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, with China's CITIC Group and Japan's Marubeni Co., Ltd. holding a small amount of shares respectively.
"AGL expects the Portland facility to continue to operate, meaning physical demand for electricity from the smelter will continue."
AGL said the contracts are so-called 'hedging contracts' which were due to take effect from November 2016.
The contract lasts for 12 months, so they will end in 2017.
"Therefore, AGL still predicts that these contracts will continue to generate revenue in  fiscal year 2017." the power company said."
From fiscal year 2018, any potential impact upon AGL's revenue is subject to positive  futures market expectation for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL said the company had already written down the value of the contracts in its accounts by $187 million in "anticipation of a termination event".
Alcoa said it was decided to terminate these contracts "will not affect Alcoa's ability to operate the smelter or to ensure that the smelter's power supply."
The US company said it signed a 20-year contract with Laoya in 2010, which would have been in effect in November, but the company did not explain why it had withdrawn from the contract.
Analysts have remained cautious about whether or not the Portland smelters in Victoria, along with the Tolgoi facility near Newcastle, will be shut down due to the economic downturn in the industry.
Regarding analysts' comments earlier this week, AGL operations director Steven Mickelson said Portland's annual electricity consumption reached about 600 megawatts and that of the Tommage plant reached about 900 megawatts.
If the two factories was closed, the demand for the electricity market would be greatly reduced.
He said: "As a power company, this is not  good news to us."
The community law center turns away 160,000 people each year.
More than 160,000 of the most vulnerable groups are shut out by community law centers each year.The funds for this service are already stretched, and now we have to face further funding cuts.
In Queensland, three out of every five people are turned down from seeking free legal advice and legal aid. Most of them are the elderly, immigrants, disadvantaged workers, victims of violent incidents, and those who have little resources to fight unfair expulsion.
The lack of funding for community legal services has already exceeded the limit and is now facing further funding cuts.
From June next year, those legal centers are slated to lose another 30 per cent of their federal funding.
James Farrell, the director of Community Legal Centers Queensland, said that every year thousands of people were shut out according to the latest report released by National Community Association Law Center.
Mr. Farrell said that if the federal government could not change the existing decision, this situation would only get worse.
"Queensland's community legal centers are chronically underfunded, which means thousands of people are unable to get the vital services they need, " he said. "
A report shows that the following people may not get the help they need: those who need to stay away from violence, who bear huge debts that cannot be repaid, who are faced with unravel families, workers who are exploited and who are faced with legal problems.
The federal government will cut its funds by 30% since June 2017, which means that thousands of vulnerable groups in Queensland will be forced to face complex legal issues without help.
We call on the Attorney-General, and Queensland Senator George Brandis to immediately reverse these funding cuts, so people can get the help they need when they're faced with a legal problem.
Last year, the state government promised to bring legal aid funding up to the national average.
It is now necessary to focus on the needs of community law centers and their corresponding communities, and the White Leaf government must also be involved in this important work.
The Donald Trump campaign team was sued of manager pulling  gun staffers.
NEW YORK: Trump's campaign team was sued for doing nothing after Trump's then-campaign director in North Carolina  pulled a gun on a staffer while driving a jeep on February.
Vincent Bordini,  a former software trainer for the state campaign team, described the incident on Wednesday in state court in Charlotte.
Bodini said he previously hoped that this matter could be resolved internally, but after having waited for a few months, he realized that “that's not likely to happen."
According to Bordini's description, the staff named Earl Philip "produced a pistol, put his right index finger on the trigger, and drove the barrel into Vincent’s knee cap."
After complaining to local and regional campaign leaders, Bodini learned from the files that at least four people had gone through the same thing.
Bodini said in the complaint: "Just because there is no  shooting does not mean that will not cause harm.""
Just two days before the case, the Republican presidential candidate told the crowd in North Carolina that if his opponent, Hillary Clinton, was elected and picked her favorite judge, the "Second Amendment people, who are  gun holders and gun enthusiasts could do something about it. The remark triggered the public outrage.
Trump's campaign team said the media mistake his words  out of context, he did not advocate violence.
Bodini in the complaint sought damage from the campaign team for their own neglect of supervision, and sought compensation from Philip for his own attacks, beatings and mental injury.
Trump spokesman Hope Hicks did not respond immediately to the news.
Can not be linked to Philip.
According to Charlotte, a local news agency WCCB reported that Philip recently left the campaign team.
His consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, did not respond immediately to the call.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's campaign team is controversial.
The two sides of the case for the Bodini and Trump presidential election company, 16-CS-14300, Mecklenburg County (Charlotte) High Court ordinary court.
Britain must pass the Olympic spirit and carry on the expansion of  Heathrow Airport.
Heathrow will also deliver regeneration and prosperity not just in our local communities and across London, but also across the country.
For me, this is the charm of Heathrow, as in the 2012 London Olympics, we make every effort to ensure that our country and region can benefit from these events.
The Olympics achieved huge benefits for Stratford and the East End.
And we will again benefit the region by creating opportunities for local people and firms around Heathrow.
For our local communities alone we are going to create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and bring an end to youth unemployment around the airport.
Just as there were ahead of London 2012, there will be people who think the challenge of Heathrow expansion is too great.
I was told that the UK would not be ready for the Olympics and we would be embarrassed  in front of the whole world.
The skeptics were wrong on 2012  Olympics  and they will be proved wrong on Heathrow as well.
While there will always be obstacles to overcome, Heathrow is solving every problem.
Like the Olympic games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for the majority instead of the minority.
Expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211billion in economic growth, leaving a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK.
We have an excellent Heathrow project team.The team has completed a £11 billion infrastructure investment project on time and within budget, including the T5 terminal, which is the world's best airport terminal for five consecutive years, and the T2 between the world's busiest runways Terminal building.
Now, they are preparing to build a third runway with a private investment of £ 16 billion.
The London 2012 Olympic Games was a great success and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow Airport project will be successful, too.
Now is a good time for us to spread the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow Airport so that we can secure our future and leave a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is chairman of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury Department.
A woman committed suicide on a highway in Swiss and was ran over and killed.
The victim was lying on the highway at midnight.
The woman who tried to commit suicide was run over by a number of cars on the highway early Thursday morning.The police are looking for witnesses.
The accident occurred on Thursday morning at the A1 motorway near Moore in Vaud.
Vaushan police said that a woman was "desperately" lying on the road but was rolled over a number of vehicles in the middle of the night.
The victim is a 49-year-old Swiss woman whose behavior clearly has suicidal intentions.She was run over by a number of cars, including a van.
This woman died on the spot.
Police said the a number of drivers involved has been investigated, but some drivers have not been confirmed yet.Now, the police are urging them and the witnesses to come forward and help in the case.
Gilles Hofstedtel's lawyer told the Geneva Tribune that there has been a criminal investigation, which is routine for such incidents.
But as yet,  no one knows if there will be drivers getting sued.
Is it possible to avoid collisions?
Hofstedt said: "This will be determined by the prosecutor."
According to the verdicts of two similar cases in the past five years, the driver will not be held responsible.
It is reported that the causes of both accidents involve people crossing the highway in the midnight.The final verdict is that a driver is hard to predict that a pedestrian will cross the highway at midnight.
Last year, a police officer was charged with negligence causing death.  She fatally hit a man on highway A1 near Payerne on August 2014.
The court was informed that the 22-year-old victim had crossed the road after drinking.
The judge said after the investigation that the policeman was fully lawful at the time, and that man appeared on the road "completely unexpected and unpredictably" and that the policewoman had made an emergency call.
Anyone with information about Thursday's incident near Morges should call police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was suitable for human habitation before.
According to NASA's new climate model, Venus was once habitable to human.
Scientists at the NASA Goddard Space Institute have developed a model that explores Venus's past situation, and the tools and algorithms used by the model are very similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model is used to determine whether the surface is hot, anhydrous, and whether Venus, whose atmosphere is full of carbon dioxide, has a similar environment to Earth's or not.
Previously, scientists believed that Venus' rotational velocity was slower because of its thicker atmosphere.
However, the latest simulations suggested that the Venus had a thinner atmosphere which was similar to the Earth, and that its rotation speed was also slower at that time.
The model also shows the terrains of early Venus.
Venus' dry areas may be more than that of the earth, but there were enough water and geographical changes to nurture life and prevent rapid evaporation.
Early, the sunshine spread out on Venus was 30% darker than that on the earth.
Anthony Del Jenio, scientist of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies，explained in a press release, "In GISS model simulation, Venus's slow rotation makes the daytime on one of its side to last almost two months in earth time." "
This makes the surface warm and produces rainwater that can form thick clouds, and the thick clouds are like an umbrella that blocks the heat of most of the sun from the ground.
The simulation result  is that Venus's average climate temperature is actually several degrees lower than the present Earth's.
Venus evolution simulated by the model is similar to  what planetary scientists previously predicted.
Although Venus may have had life, in the course of billions of years, Venus exposes to high temperature and ultraviolet light.
The water from the oceans on the planet evaporate and the water vapor is burnt out by ultraviolet rays.
With the escape of hydrogen, only a thicker carbon dioxide atmosphere and the fatal greenhouse gas were left, which formed the Venus we know today.
Researchers published in "Geophysical Research Letters" new Venus climate model simulation results.
Patrick Roy resigns as Avalanche coach.
Patrick Roy resigned from the head coach and vice president of the Colorado avalanche ice hockey on Thursday, saying he had no say at the team's decision-making level.
Colorado executive vice president general manager Joe Sagez confirmed the news and said the club will immediately start looking for a new head coach.
For the past three years, I have carried out my duties as Head Coach and Vice President of Hockey Operations for the Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination."
I thought about how to improve the team in the summer, so that it has a higher level of strength.
To this end, head coach and vice president goals must be consistent with the club's goals.
He must also have a voice about the decisions that influence the team's performance.
But at present, these conditions are not yet met.
Sachs hired Roy on May 23, 2013, and he thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
Satchi said: "Patrick told me his decision today."
We thank him for his contribution to the club and wish him the best in the future.
Roy was nominated for Jack Adams Award as coach of the year during his first season as Colorado Avalanche head coach in 2013 - 14.
He helped the club get 112 points, ranking first in the middle district.But the Colorado team were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by the Minnesota team, thus missing the rest of the playoffs in the last two years.
The Avalanche posted a 39-39-4 mark in 2015-16 and fell five points shy of the Wild for the second wild-card spot in the Western Conference.
As a goalkeeper in the Hockey Hall of Fame, Roy won a total of four Stanley Cups during his career, two with the Montreal Canadians and two with the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers stopped the  strike,  and resumed negotiation.
The chief negotiator said the workers in the North Sea oil field had started a strike regarding their pay, and the parties involved in the dispute began a new round of negotiations.
Strikes against oilfield service company Wood Group has been staged multiple times on oil rigs run by the  Royal Dutch Shell.
According to a joint statement, "Wood Group and Unite and RMT unions have confirmed that we have agreed to restart the current dispute resolution process."
Starting from the next week, we will hold a number of all-day meetings to re-examine these issues in the coming weeks.
The union said its recent action was aiming at protesting  possible 30% pay cut, and this was the first action that the union had taken in 25 years.
Due to market pressure, Wood Group reduced payment for North Sea contractor by about 9% this year.
Prior to this pay cut, the company reduced its payment for onshore contractors by 10% in 2014.
The company said that a further pay cut would help the company to go through the market turn-down.
Shell has cut thousands of employees and announced plans to shut down oil and gas operations  in 10 countries because the company needs to streamline its business after merging with British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are facing pressures from falling crude oil prices and Britain's decision to exit the Europe in June.
Scottish Parliament member Dave Anderson met with leaders of the labor union earlier this week, working together to discuss the biggest labor dispute involving the people living in the North Sea area.
He said the North Sea is vital to the regional economy.
"In the North Sea and the country as a whole, we need an economy that serves the majority, not the minority, " Dave said in a statement."
In 2016, new North Sea project is expected to spend less than $ 1.4 billion on new projects, while the average spending in the past five years is about $ 7 billion.
Kepler measured the rotational speed of the Pleiades
The latest mission of the Kepler telescope will help astronomers gather accurate information on the rotation of the Pleiades Star Cluster.
The new data is helping astronomers understand why stars in the star cluster have different rotational speeds and how the rotation period is associated with the planet forming.
"We hope to compare our results to other star clusters to further understand a star's mass, age, and even it's history related to the solar system," said Lusa Rebel, a research scientist at the Pasadena California Institute of Technology's Infrared Processing Analysis Center, at a news conference."
The Pleiades are 445 light years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster were born about 125 million years ago and are now just reaching adulthood.
They reached the highest rotation speed in their lifetime.
Reaching the maximum possible rotating speed, these mature stars emit ample stellar winds.
When these stellar winds pass through the stars' magnetic field, they have a braking effect on the stars.
With the increase in the age of stars, their rotation speed begin to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotation speed of each star by tracking the time at which the recognizable stellar starspots (like sunspots) appear.
The latest rotation speed data set indicates that the speed of stars with larger mass is slower than the speed of stars with smaller mass.
Rebel compares the stars to dancers, and the larger dancers rotate slower than the smaller dancers.
Rebull said, "In the 'ballet show' of the Pleiades cluster, we see that slow-rotating stars tend to be more massive, whereas the fastest rotators tend to be the lightest stars.""
Due to the close distance of the Pleiades, it can be used as an ideal cosmic laboratory for comparing star mass and self-rotation speed.
Rebuer states that: "The Pleiper Cluster has laid the foundation for the theoretical model of the two-way rotation of young and old stars."
There is still a lot of knowledge about how stars, when and why they slow down the speed and "put away their own shoes" that we need to discover.
Rebel and her colleagues elaborated their latest analysis of rotational velocity of Pleiades cluster in these three new papers.These three papers will soon be published in the journal "Astronomy".
